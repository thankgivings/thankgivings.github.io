        <h2><strong>What.time does frys.close on thanksgiving Charlie brown the origins of thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>In the <b>19th</b> century, the modern Thanksgiving holiday started to take shape. In 1846, Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of a magazine called Godey&rsquo;s Lady&rsquo;s Book, campaigned for an annual national...  The first Thanksgiving was a <b>harvest</b> celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  The <b>myth</b> of the first Thanksgiving refers to the mythologized retelling of a <b>1621</b> harvest feast by the Puritans in Plymouth, Massachusetts as the foundation for the modern Thanksgiving holiday as celebrated in the United States.  The National <b>Thanksgiving</b> Proclamation was the first presidential proclamation of Thanksgiving in the United States. At the request of Congress, President George Washington declared Thursday, November 26, 1789 as a day of public thanksgiving and prayer. [1]  What is the date of the First Thanksgiving?

Why do Native Americans object to Thanksgiving?  &quot;The first thanksgiving,&quot; as a <b>Pilgrim</b> <b>feast</b> in 1621 subsequently came to be known, was not a religious celebration. Instead, the Pilgrims held a three-day feast to celebrate the success of their first harvest sometime between September and early October in 1621.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> was <b>first</b> celebrated to give thanks for the harvest. The event that Americans commonly call the &quot;First Thanksgiving&quot; was celebrated by the Pilgrims after their first feast in the New World in October 1621.
