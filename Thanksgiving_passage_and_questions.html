        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving passage and questions Thanksgiving poster backgrounds</strong></h2>
        <p>Most Americans are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North America. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees.  That&#39;s why many Native Americans and others mark <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a solemn day of remembrance instead of celebration. Here&#39;s what really went down after the plates were cleared in Plymouth, Mass.  According to Baker, &quot;the American holiday&#39;s true origin was the <b>New</b> <b>England</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Never coupled with a Sabbath meeting, the Pilgrim observances were special days set aside during the week for thanksgiving and praise in response to God&#39;s providence.&quot; [32]  The United States holiday <b>of Thanksgiving </b>is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens <b>of </b>Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans <b>of </b>the Wampanoag Confederacy <b>in </b>the fall <b>of </b>1621.  Today, as millions <b>of </b>American families gather together <b>in </b>celebration <b>of Thanksgiving</b>, many remain unaware <b>of </b>the real history behind the holiday. While <b>in </b>school, most children are taught that...  For starters, Pocahontas, a member of the Powhatan tribe, died in <b>1617</b>, four years before the first Thanksgiving. And according to the real history of Thanksgiving in America, settlers were...  Thanksgiving remains a controversial event and critics argue that it glosses over the brutal conflict faced by Native Americans during the <b>early</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>era</b>. Here is a closer look at the history of Thanksgiving as it evolved through American history.  This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of Thanksgiving, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such <b>in</b> <b>1863</b>.  Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>feast</b> shared by the English colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving anxiety.
