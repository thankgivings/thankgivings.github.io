        <h2><strong>What state held the first thanksgiving Things to do on thanksgiving with your family</strong></h2>
        <p>It&#39;s just three simple steps: You can dry brine your <b>turkey</b> the night before or as far in advance as two days. Take your bird from blah to &quot;bam!&quot; with spices. Try a Cajun-style <b>turkey</b> rub...  To add extra flavor and tenderness to your Thanksgiving turkey, try <b>a</b> basic <b>brine</b>, or you could even go for a dry brine. Soaking the turkey in this saltwater mixture helps to tenderize the meat while adding flavor and moisture throughout the entire turkey.  A turkey <b>breast</b> is roasted with a flavorful combination of butter and <b>seasonings</b> and served with homemade pan gravy for an easy <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration.  Step 1 In a medium bowl, whisk together the salt, garlic powder, lemon pepper, brown sugar, paprika, sage, onion powder, thyme, and cayenne, if using. Step 2 To use: Thoroughly pat the <b>turkey</b> dry with paper towels.  This is a classic, flavorful <b>turkey</b> <b>seasoning</b> that&#39;s made from a simple mix of pantry staple ingredients. Rub it on your <b>turkey</b> before roasting for a no-fuss, fail-proof, impressive <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner.  If you&#39;re looking for a quicker solution, simply rub the <b>turkey</b> <b>breast</b> with olive oil, salt, pepper, and a fresh herb butter&mdash;it&#39;s perfect for a <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner for two. When shopping, look for bone-in and skin-on <b>turkey</b> <b>breast</b>.  Brined, buttered, and roasted for tons of moist flavor, this foolproof method of preparing <b>turkey</b> <b>breast</b> is sure to make your <b>Thanksgiving</b> special.  A roasted <b>turkey</b> <b>breast</b> is a great alternative to a larger turkey for a smaller Thanksgiving crowd. The average turkey <b>breast</b> feeds 5 to 6 people and can be flavored any way you prefer.  Here is how to season a turkey so it comes out flavorful and juicy &mdash; just the way you want it. There are two main ways you can season a <b>turkey</b>. <b>Dry</b> <b>brine</b>: <b>Combine</b> <b>salt</b>, <b>pepper</b>, <b>dried</b> <b>herbs</b>, <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> and rub the mixture under the turkey skin, inside the cavity, and then over the skin. Let sit overnight or up to 24 hours. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving dinner riddles. The first macys thanksgiving day parade. Thanksgiving buffet grapevine tx.
