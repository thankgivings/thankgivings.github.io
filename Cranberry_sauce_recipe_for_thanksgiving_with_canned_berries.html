        <p>Discover four surprising Catholic origins of the beloved U.S. holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  Turkey, football, family and an endless number of pies often fill <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in America. All over the country, people will gather with friends and family to <b>celebrate</b> this national holiday ...  Living <b>Thanksgiving</b> Like a Catholic: 7 Ways to Embrace Gratitude. Attend Thanksgiving Mass: Begin the day by participating in Mass, expressing gratitude through Christ&rsquo;s offering. Start with a Prayer: Prioritize a prayer of thanksgiving before indulging in the day&rsquo;s festivities.  Turkey, football, family and an endless number of pies often fill <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in America. All over the country, people will gather with friends and family to <b>celebrate</b> this national holiday. While it has become a commercialized secular holiday for many people, there is still so much about this day that is aligned with our Catholic faith.  In fact, Thanksgiving is really <b>a</b> Catholic <b>feast</b> <b>day</b>. Although that first Thanksgiving date is unclear, historians note that when the Catholic Spanish explorers landed in the New World, each celebrated a feast with local Native Americans giving thanks to this new land.

Father Francis Weiser, S.J., in the chapter on Thanksgiving in his Handbook of Christian Feasts and Customs, elaborates how the act of thanksgiving...  3. <b>Celebrate</b> St. Martin. In Catholic tradition, one of the great saints we <b>celebrate</b> in November is St. Martin of Tours, famous for this act of charity towards a needy beggar. His November 11th feast, called Martinmas, was <b>celebrated</b> much like our <b>Thanksgiving</b>: harvest vegetables, wine from the summer vintage, even roast goose. </p>        <p>The start of thanksgiving. <a href="./618.html">Thanksgiving wordsearch image</a>.
