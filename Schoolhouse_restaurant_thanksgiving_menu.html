        <h2><strong>Schoolhouse restaurant thanksgiving menu Thanksgiving card for mother in law</strong></h2>
        <p>Hoping to unify a badly divided country and comfort those who had suffered terrible losses since the outset of the war, Lincoln declared a National Day of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, to be celebrated on the last <b>Thursday</b> of <b>November</b>. This was just the <b>third</b> federal holiday to be declared. Only Independence Day and Washington&rsquo;s birthday are older.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> of November. [2] . Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  The holiday has fallen the third Thursday of every November since Abraham Lincoln proclaimed it a regular national day in 1863, meaning that Americans will celebrate the day on Thursday <b>24</b>...  The first &quot;Day of Publick <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; was on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>Nov</b>. 26, 1789.

Thanksgiving is on its latest possible date in <b>2024</b>, according to NBC Chicago. The holiday always occurs on the fourth Thursday of November, but the dates can differ based on leap years.  In 2024, Thanksgiving will be observed on Thursday, November <b>28</b>. Thanksgiving has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year. The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is November 22; the latest is November 28.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is one of the most popular holidays in the United States, but formally establishing the day on which it is to be observed was difficult and fraught with controversy. By federal law, Americans have celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the fourth <b>Thursday</b> in <b>November</b> since 1942, but numerous other dates were designated in the past.  This year, we celebrate Thanksgiving <b>on</b> November <b>28</b>, <b>2024</b>&mdash;the date changes year to year but it always falls on the fourth Thursday of the month.  Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on <b>Thursday</b>, November <b>28</b>.
