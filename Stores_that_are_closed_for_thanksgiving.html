        <p>From colorful gourds to festive wreaths, these are some of our favorite outdoor fall <b>decor</b> ideas, versatile enough to span the season from September through Thanksgiving. Plus, many of these displays can be brought indoors and used as fall centerpieces during seasonal entertaining.  Decorating with fall <b>lanterns</b> will add the perfect ambiance to your interior and exterior living spaces. The great thing about lanterns, you can fill them with <b>gourds</b>, <b>pumpkins</b>, nuts, leaves and other seasonal materials to create a beautiful autumn display.  Use the easy step-by-step instructions below to make leaf luminaries for your fall lantern walk, autumn DIY home <b>decor</b>, a fall wedding, or to add to your festive holiday decor for Thanksgiving, the winter solstice, or Christmas.  How to use these <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>lanterns</b> as a blessing, gratitude, or thankful jar: First, cut construction paper or colored cardstock into strips. Next, place paper strips on the table with a marker or pen next to the <b>Thanksgiving</b> gratitude jar and encourage dinner guests to write what they are thankful for on the strips.  Blakc metal <b>lanterns</b> with corn and real pumpkins are harvest-like and cool for Thanksgiving <b>decor</b>. IKEA Borrby lantern spray painted copper with foliage, blooms, fake pumpkins and flowers and candles is a great fall centerpiece.  <b>Decorating</b> your outside space with cozy lights and <b>lanterns</b> is a nice way to make your home&#39;s entrance feel more warm and inviting during dark and cold winter nights &ndash; and there are so many unique lighting options to choose from.  Candle <b>jar</b> <b>lanterns</b> are one of my favorite ways to decorate for any season, but especially in the fall. Leaves, pumpkins, and gourds are perfect for representing that favorite cool, but not too cold, season each year. These easy candle lanterns are a perfect addition to your Thanksgiving table.  Don&rsquo;t forget to repurpose your lanterns for Thanksgiving. Instead of candles, fill them with collections of tiny <b>pumpkins</b> and other gourds and use them as centerpieces for an outdoor buffet table. More little pumpkins and sprays of red berries arranged around an especially heavy or severe lamp lighten it.  <b>How</b> To <b>Decorate</b> <b>A</b> <b>Lantern</b> For Fall (quick and easy fall <b>ideas</b> ) <b>#howtodecoratealanternforfall</b> #Falllanternideas #falldecor2019 On todays video i want to show you three quick... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving travel volume.
