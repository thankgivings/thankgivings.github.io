        <p>Now as they were eating, <b>Jesus</b> took <b>bread</b>, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is my body.&rdquo; And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.  And as they were eating, Jesus took <b>bread</b>, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, ...  While they were eating, <b>Jesus</b> took <b>bread</b>, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, &ldquo;Take and eat; this is my body.&rdquo; New Living Translation As they were eating, <b>Jesus</b> took some <b>bread</b> and blessed it.  <b>Breaking</b> <b>bread</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> act that goes beyond the physical action. The Greek word &quot;&kappa;&lambda;Î¬&sigma;&alpha;&sigmaf;&quot; (klasas) indicates a deliberate and purposeful breaking. This act is reminiscent of Jesus&#39; words at the Last Supper, where He broke the bread as a symbol of His body being broken for the salvation of humanity ( Luke 22:19 ).  Now as they were eating, <b>Jesus</b> took <b>bread</b>, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is my body.&rdquo; And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Thus, when <b>Jesus</b> TOOK <b>bread</b>, BLESSED God, BROKE the <b>bread</b>, and GAVE it to his disciples, ritually, he was enacting a sacrifice of <b>thanksgiving</b> in which it was understood the <b>bread</b> was his body, and the cup was his blood.  <b>Jesus</b> took some <b>bread</b> in his hands and gave thanks for it. He broke the <b>bread</b> and handed it to his apostles. Then he said, &quot;This is my body, which is given for you. Eat this as a way of remembering me!&quot;  19 And he took <b>bread</b>, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.&rdquo; 20 In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. Scripture quoted by permission.  And he took <b>bread</b>, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&rdquo; And likewise the cup after they had &hellip; </p>        <p>Thanksgiving baskets for the needy in denver colorado. Quotes expressing gratitude to teachers.
