        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving activities in philadelphia Horn of food thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>The <b>Dallas </b>Cowboys and <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a decade-old tradition. America&rsquo;s Team playing on an American holiday is a match made in heaven. But how did this storied franchise come to play every <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We look at how the tradition started, their record, and who they play in 2023.  The Dallas Cowboys have a long history of playing on <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Here&#39;s how it all started, with a full list of games played since the tradition began in 1966.  One of the most well-known traditions in the NFL is <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day. Along with the Detroit Lions, the Dallas Cowboys play on the holiday every season, dating back to 1966 for Dallas (with the exception of 1975 and 1977).  In most years, Cowboys players will visit a Salvation Army shelter in Dallas or Fort Worth and feed early <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day meals to those in need, although that practice was put on hold in 2020...  Dallas has played on Thanksgiving Day <b>every</b> <b>year</b> <b>since</b> <b>1966</b>, except for &#39;75 and &#39;77 when the NFL awarded the game to the St. Louis Cardinals, again in an attempt to boost the team&rsquo;s...  In honor of the 11th matchup between the NFC East foes on Thursday, here&rsquo;s a look at all 10 games, in which <b>Dallas </b>is 8-2. Tom Landry and the 9-2 Cowboys were 20-point favorites over Washington, who were 4-7 at the time, coached by legendary Cleveland Browns quarterback Otto Graham.  With the Cowboys traditionally hosting <b>Thanksgiving</b> games since 1966, playing Washington on the fourth Thursday of November always seems to spark nostalgia &mdash; even though Dallas holds an 8-2...  While many teams weren&rsquo;t interested, Dallas Cowboys GM Tex Schramm believed the publicity of playing on <b>Thanksgiving</b> would be good for his struggling team in 1966. Schramm&rsquo;s decision paid off on the field and at the gate, which is why the tradition has continued and in part is why the Cowboys are known as &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Team.&rdquo;  The Dallas Cowboys play on <b>Thanksgiving</b> every year. What is the team&#39;s record and history on the day, and what were their biggest moments? </p>        <p>Thanksgiving vegetables serious eats. First thanksgiving abcteach.
