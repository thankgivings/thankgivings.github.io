        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving dinner catering in chicago Thanksgiving mom fuck</strong></h2>
        <p>Since the historic <b>meal</b> in 1621, <b>Thanksgiving</b> traditions have changed and evolved with American culture. From turkey and stuffing to potatoes and pies, we know what dishes to expect at our holiday tables today, but you might be surprised to learn what foods the Pilgrims and Wampanoag brought to the table and what didn&rsquo;t make the cut.  Traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> includes turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes but the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge and venison. Bettmann / Corbis  &quot;<b>Sobaheg</b>&quot; means stew in the Wampanoag language, and there&#39;s a good chance it was served as part of the first Thanksgiving meal. A traditional autumn sobaheg contains a mixture of cooked beans, corn, squash, and nuts, all seasoned with salt.  The meal consisted of <b>deer</b>, corn, <b>shellfish</b>, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional Thanksgiving feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were...  From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was eaten <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  Neither Bradford or Winslow&rsquo;s writing reveal what was actually served at the first Thanksgiving meal, besides fowl and deer, but guesses can be made based on the types of food they often wrote about such as <b>mussels</b>, lobsters, <b>grapes</b>, plums, corn and herbs.  The first Thanksgiving banquet consisted of foods <b>like</b> <b>venison</b>, <b>bean</b> <b>stew</b> <b>and</b> <b>hard</b> <b>biscuits</b>. And while corn and pumpkin had their place on the table, they hardly resembled the cornbread stuffing and pumpkin pie we feast on today.  What was the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> food? Find out what was <b>served</b> at the very first <b>Thanksgiving</b> (and what wasn&#39;t) from wildfowl to produce.  So what foods were <b>served</b> <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden <b>meal</b> but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well. </p>        <p>Happy thanksgiving hungarian.
