From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  There were no forks, but there was plenty of seafood and sides. 1. Venison. Edward Winslow&#39;s December 1621 letter that mentions the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> gathering doesn&#39;t offer up a ton of specifics about what was served that day, but one thing he made certain was that the Native Americans brought five deer to the meal. </p>        <p>Gospel coalition thanksgiving.
