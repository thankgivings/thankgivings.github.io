        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving questions for preschool Thanksgiving canada statutory holiday</strong></h2>
        <p>The <b>origins</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, like with most other traditional festivities, are rooted in old pagan rites. The <b>holiday</b> has its earliest source in ancient customs found throughout the globe that allocated a day of giving thanks for a successful harvest and the fortunes or blessings of the previous year .  By the time Abraham Lincoln declared <b>Thanksgiving</b> a National <b>holiday</b> in 1861, other Europeans had also settled in America and brought with them their own traditions, some Pagan. Harvest festivals were celebrated by European Romans at Cerelia by giving thanks to Ceres, the Goddess of Harvest.  Some people believe that there are pagan origins behind the Thanksgiving celebration. The most popular theory is that the holiday is based on <b>ancient</b> pagan <b>harvest</b> <b>festivals</b>. These festivals, which were celebrated in many cultures, honored the gods and goddesses of fertility and the harvest.  Thanksgiving&#39;s origins can be traced back <b>to</b> <b>Greek</b> and <b>Roman</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>celebrations</b>, by strict dictionary definition, this alone makes Thanksgiving a pagan holiday (ie, polytheistic). You can read a detailed history of Thanksgiving here: www.congregationsofgod.org/thanksgiving.  The official version states that Thanksgiving started in <b>1621</b> with a three day feast by pilgrims to celebrate their survival through their first winter in the new world. It was later made a permanent holiday by President Lincoln in 1863.  Everything has <b>origins</b>: from the stories we tell at the dinner table, to the very <b>holidays</b> we celebrate. <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a well-worshiped, highly celebrated occasion in the United States, but like many other celebrations, this <b>holiday</b> has roots in pagan traditions.  A quick online search of &ldquo;<b>cornucopia</b>&rdquo; will reveal its Greek and Roman pagan origins. It&rsquo;s often associated with the Roman goddess Abundantia (as illustrated in the above painting by Rubens). The...  Since the original Pilgrims came from England before journeying to America, it makes sense many of the original Thanksgiving traditions came from older European celebrations. It is believed the holiday is directly tied to the &ldquo;<b>Harvest</b> Home&rdquo; festival that was celebrated in England around this time.  Read about <b>Thanksgiving</b>&#39;s <b>origins</b>, the first Thanksgiving, and how to celebrate modern Thanksgiving as an American pagan (native or not). </p>        <p><a href="./103.html">How to attend macys thanksgiving day parade on the cheap</a>.
