        <h2><strong>Why do people forget thanksgiving Thanksgiving turkey skiing pictures</strong></h2>
        <p>In Canada, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> <b>October</b>, which is about six weeks earlier than in the United States, where it falls on the fourth Thursday in November. The earlier Canadian Thanksgiving aligns with the country&#39;s earlier harvest season due to the northern climate.  Here is how Canada celebrates their big holiday as well as four ways that the Canadian and U.S. Thanksgivings differ. 1. <b>Canadian</b> Thanksgiving <b>is</b> <b>in</b> October&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian Thanksgiving happens a full month and a half before American Thanksgiving, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  In <b>Canada</b>, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday in October. <b>In the United States</b>, it is on the fourth Thursday in November. Although its origins are religious, today, Thanksgiving is a largely secular holiday.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day <b>is </b>an annual national holiday <b>in the </b>United States <b>and Canada </b>celebrating <b>the </b>harvest <b>and </b>other blessings of <b>the </b>past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving is </b>modeled on <b>a </b>1621 harvest feast shared by <b>the </b>European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth <b>and the </b>Wampanoag people.  A food decoration for Erntedankfest, a Christian Thanksgiving harvest <b>festival</b> celebrated in Germany. The Harvest Thanksgiving <b>Festival</b>, Erntedankfest, is a popular Christian <b>festival</b> in some German municipalities on the first Sunday of October. The <b>festival</b> has a significant religious component, and many churches are decorated with autumn crops.  Thanksgiving <b>is</b> one of the biggest holidays of the year in the United States&mdash;with huge parades, massive feasts, and football&mdash;but it&rsquo;s decidedly lower key in Canada. Although the holiday is still widely celebrated in Canada and is a statutory holiday in most of the country*, Canadians&rsquo; approach to Thanksgiving is a bit more laid back.  In both the <b>United States</b> <b>and Canada</b>, Thanksgiving is a holiday to give thanks, enjoy a feast with family, and celebrate a bountiful harvest. But that&rsquo;s where the similarities end. To honour Canadian Thanksgiving in 2022, we look at how <b>Canada</b> does Thanksgiving differently &ndash; from the history and the date to the food and traditions. 1.  Thanksgiving <b>in the United States</b> is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November and is traditionally associated with a feast commemorating the Pilgrims&#39; harvest in 1621, while Thanksgiving in <b>Canada</b> is observed on the second Monday of October and is a celebration of gratitude for the blessings of the year.  Rivaling only the major winter holidays in scope, Thanksgiving <b>in the United States</b> is often an excuse to gather family to celebrate gratitude, togetherness, and the bounty of harvest. But the roots of the holiday come from an oft-misrepresented and very specific moment in American history. </p>        <p>Walt disney world fall 2024 discounts.
