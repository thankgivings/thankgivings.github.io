        <p><b>Seafood</b> is a rare sight on a modern Thanksgiving table, but the colonists most likely had fish, eel, and shellfish, such as lobster and mussels, at their feast. Vegetarians would not have gone hungry in 1621.  In addition to wildfowl and deer, the group probably feasted on <b>eels</b> and shellfish like <b>lobster</b>, clams, and mussels, all staples of the coastal Wampanoag. &ldquo;They were drying shellfish and smoking other sorts of fish,&rdquo; says Wall. Wait, so <b>lobster</b> may have been present at the first Thanksgiving! (Perhaps we begin a new tradition?)  The <b>Wampanoags</b> also likely introduced the Pilgrims to local seafood like mussels, lobster, and eels, and taught them how to forage foods from the surrounding forests such as chestnuts and walnuts. The food was definitely plentiful for the roughly 90 Wampanoags and 50 colonists who were present.  The First Thanksgiving meal eaten by pilgrims in November 1621 included <b>lobster</b>. They also ate fruits and vegetables brought by Native Americans, mussels, bass, clams, and oysters. Back in 1621, lobsters were so plentiful that you could grab them by the hand straight out of the ocean at low tide.  John, with the first Thanksgiving in mind, brought a whole fish, just like when British settlers and the Wampanoag tribe shared <b>eel</b>, <b>lobster</b>, and shellfish. When my father and I arrived in his Yugo to pick up the couple, John had a fish on a tray.  It was likely access to a wider range of foods, including dairy and chicken, and a general inclination toward a more Westernized palate that killed <b>eels</b>&#39; rightful place on the Thanksgiving table. It might be time to bring it back.  They also ate venison from the five deer that the Indians brought to the celebration, as well as duck and geese. <b>Eels</b>, <b>lobster</b>, clams, bass, oysters, and mussels were abundant along the New England coast and would have found their place at the harvest table.  In any case, seafood was prominent, and fortunately all species the pioneers ate still swim in the sea. You might be serving <b>eels</b>, <b>lobster</b>, clams, and mussels along with some other kind of smoked fish, historians say. History of the first Thanksgiving  They likely ate turkey, but the Wampanoag also brought deer meat to the feast. Experts say the menu also included fish, <b>lobster</b>&mdash;<b>and eels</b>! But back then, there wasn&rsquo;t any cranberry sauce and, sadly, no pumpkin pie for dessert. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving break bloomsburg. Thanksgiving 2024 store deals.
