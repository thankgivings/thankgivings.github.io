        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving weather new orleans Thanksgiving day in grenada</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> in <b>Canada</b> is linked to the European tradition of harvest festivals. A common image seen at this time of year is a cornucopia, or horn, filled with seasonal fruit and vegetables. The cornucopia, which means &quot;Horn of Plenty&quot; in Latin, was a symbol of bounty and plenty in ancient Greece.  Since 1957, Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> has been a holiday in <b>Canada</b> on the second Monday of October. Canadian Thanksgiving is a chance for people to give thanks for fortunes in the past year, including a good harvest. Below, we will explain what people do on Canadian Thanksgiving, as well as the ways that it differs from U.S. Thanksgiving.  The first official Thanksgiving <b>day</b> in <b>Canada</b> on record came after confederation on April 15 1872 to celebrate the recovery of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) from a serious illness. By 1879, Thanksgiving was declared an official Canadian national holiday, though its precise date shifted between November and October for years to come.  The citizens of Halifax commemorated the end of the Seven Years&rsquo; War in 1763 with a <b>day</b> of Thanksgiving, and Loyalists subsequently brought the celebration to other parts of the country. When and why has Thanksgiving been observed in <b>Canada</b>? The first national Thanksgiving in <b>Canada</b> was celebrated in the Province of <b>Canada</b> in 1859. It was ...  <b>Canada</b>&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Traditions. Thanksgiving, in some form or another, has been a part of Canadian life since the mid-19th Century. The holiday moved around to a number of different dates for more than a century, until 1957, when the Canadian Parliament declared &ldquo;A <b>Day</b> of General Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which <b>Canada</b> has been blessed &mdash; to be observed ...  In <b>Canada</b>, Thanksgiving is a time for families to gather and enjoy a turkey dinner while celebrating the harvest. However, unlike in the United States, relatives tend not to travel as far. This is because the holiday occurs in early October, and the weather is typically mild enough for a Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> hike or vacation.  Parliament officially declares Thanksgiving as &ldquo;a <b>day</b> of general thanksgiving to almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which <b>Canada</b> has been blessed.&rdquo; While this mandate for Thanksgiving may not be observed by all Canadians in its entirety, the ideas of being thankful, of spending time with family, and sharing a delicious meal still ...  In the United States, the <b>day</b> after Thanksgiving is Black Friday, with the largest number of offers in stores in the country. However, this did not happen in <b>Canada</b>, because the main <b>day</b> for sales promotions is Boxing <b>Day</b>, which takes place on December 26th. Canadian holidays are smaller than American holidays.  Unlike American Thanksgiving, <b>Canada</b>&rsquo;s national Thanksgiving date took decades to become standardized and annual. In 1957, <b>Canada</b>&rsquo;s parliament set the date as the second Monday in October. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving lesson plans for toddlers. 7th heaven thanksgiving episode.
