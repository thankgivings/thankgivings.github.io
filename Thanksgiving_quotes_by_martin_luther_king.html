        <p>What is the date of the First Thanksgiving? The First Thanksgiving is dated to <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday? Thanksgiving became an American holiday in 1863 but was not observed in every state until after 1963. Why do Native Americans object to Thanksgiving?  During the autumn of 1621, at least 90 Wampanoag joined 52 English people at what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, to mark a successful harvest. It is remembered today as the <b>&ldquo;First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; although no one back then used that term.

Here&#39;s what really went down after the plates were cleared in Plymouth, Mass.

According to the Texas Society Daughters of the American Colonists, the very first thanksgiving was observed by Spanish <b>explorer</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>Vasquez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Coronado</b>. Accompanied by 1,500 men in...  The first Thanksgiving service known to be held by Europeans in North America occurred on <b>May</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1578</b>, in Newfoundland, although earlier Church-type services were probably held by Spaniards in La Florida.  Colonists and the Wampanoag tribe shared an autumn harvest feast in 1621 in Plymouth, Massachusetts that is widely acknowledged as one of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations.
