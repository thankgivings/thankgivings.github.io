        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving prayers for families Good luck charlie its a charlie duncan thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>What Is Chuseok? Chuseok is a <b>Korean</b> <b>holiday</b> for Koreans to give thanks for the bountiful harvest and to celebrate the abundance of food with family. Chuseok as <b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Because both <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in other countries and Chuseok celebrate and appreciate the successful harvest, many foreigners consider Chuseok as <b>Korean</b> ...  Chuseok (추석), also known as Hangawi, marks a zenith in the <b>Korean</b> calendar, rivaling only the lunar New Year in its cultural significance. Often likened to <b>Thanksgiving</b>, this festival is observed on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, typically aligning with September or October by the Gregorian reckoning.  Chuseok (추석) &ndash; otherwise known as <b>Hangawi</b> (<b>한가위</b>) by Koreans or as &ldquo;Korean Thanksgiving&rdquo; by Westerners &ndash; is one of the most significant public holidays in Korea, together with Seollal or the Korean New Year (설날).  Chuseok is commonly incorrectly translated as &quot;<b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; in American English despite the holidays being vastly different in origin and celebration. [8][9] Although most South Koreans visit their families and ancestral homes, there are festivities held at the National Folk Museum of Korea.  Chuseok, also known as Korean Thanksgiving Day, is one of the most important and festive holidays of the year. This year, Chuseok falls on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>September</b> <b>19th</b>, but the holiday period actually lasts for three days in total &ndash; including the day before and after Chuseok.  September 17, 2024 is Chuseok <b>(Korean Thanksgiving</b>) in South <b>Korea</b> and this is one of the important traditional festivals for Koreans. Let&rsquo;s talk about some interesting customs about the <b>Korean</b> Chuseok in this blog post. What is Chuseok (추석)?  We are celebrating Chuseok, one of the most important holidays on the Korean calendar and known as Korean <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day. In this piece, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the dazzling kaleidoscope that is this extraordinary festival.  Chuseok translates to &quot;autumn eve&quot; and is, at its core, a harvest moon festival nodding back to <b>Korea</b>&#39;<b>s</b> traditional agrarian roots. It usually falls sometime in late September to early October (this year it&#39;s Sept. 30 to Oct. 2).  Chuseok, also known <b>as</b> <b>Hangawi</b> (한가위), is a major harvest festival celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar. Falling in late September or early October, it is a time to give thanks for the bountiful harvest and offer respect to one&rsquo;s ancestors. </p>        <p>Easy no bake thanksgiving treats.
