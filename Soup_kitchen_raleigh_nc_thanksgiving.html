        <h2><strong>Soup kitchen raleigh nc thanksgiving 17 mile drive hours thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Since 1957, Thanksgiving Day has been a holiday in Canada on the second Monday of <b>October</b>. Canadian Thanksgiving is a chance for people to give thanks for fortunes in the past year, including a good harvest. Below, we will explain what people do on Canadian Thanksgiving, as well as the ways that it differs from U.S. Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving Day in Canada has been a holiday on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> since 1957. It is a chance for people to give thanks for a good harvest and other fortunes in the past year. Thanksgiving Day in Canada is a time for family and food.  Thanksgiving in Canada is celebrated on <b>the</b> second <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> every year. This corresponds to October 14, 2024. Canadian Thanksgiving has a rich history and story behind it that is not rooted in the American celebration. Thanksgiving is an official holiday in Canada.  Beginning in 1921, Thanksgiving and Armistice Day (introduced in 1919) were celebrated on the same day &mdash; the first Monday in the <b>week</b> of <b>11</b> <b>November</b>. In order to give more recognition to veterans, 11 November was set solely as Remembrance Day in 1931.  Today Canadian Thanksgiving is held on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> every year, or at least it has been since Canadian Parliament declared it so on January 31, 1957. Before this, Thanksgiving in Canada had been held sporadically, often coinciding with other major events and anniversaries.  Since 1957, Canadian Thanksgiving has been celebrated on the <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b>. This change was made to separate the celebration of the harvest from the Remembrance Day commemorations of Canadian War veterans held in November.  Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> and American <b>Thanksgiving</b> may look similar at first glance, but there are a a few things that set these two fall festivities apart. Here&#39;s a list of the 4 biggest differences between Canadian and American Thanksgiving!  We&#39;ll start with the biggie: when is Canadian Thanksgiving, anyway? Unlike Thanksgiving, which always falls on the fourth Thursday of November no matter the date, Canada&#39;s version occurs on the second Monday in <b>October</b>&mdash;<b>which</b> is <b>October</b> <b>9</b> in <b>2023</b>.  Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving on the second <b>Monday</b> in <b>October</b>, while Thanksgiving in the United States is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November.
