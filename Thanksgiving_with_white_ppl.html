        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving with white ppl Thanksgiving dress</strong></h2>
        <p>That is the question Al Mohler asks on his blog, saying <b>atheists</b> might think they are thankful, but they can&#39;t really celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday because they don&#39;t believe in God: Thanksgiving <b>is</b> a deeply theological act, rightly understood.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a deeply theological act, rightly understood. As a matter of fact, thankfulness is a theology in microcosm &mdash; a key to understanding what we really believe about God, ourselves, and the world we experience. A haunting question is this: How do <b>atheists</b> observe <b>Thanksgiving</b>?  What exactly can <b>Thanksgiving</b> mean to someone who is an <b>atheist</b> or a secularist? How in an increasingly secular society can we talk about a common holiday in which the common purpose is to give thanks?  But an <b>atheist</b> who speaks of being thankful at such moments faces a dilemma. <b>Thankfulness</b> means a feeling or expression of gratitude. But if one believes there is no intelligence superintending the events for which one is thankful then to whom is one thankful?  But many of the nonreligious will also include a moment of thanks, as &ldquo;secular <b>grace</b>&rdquo; grows in popularity among atheists, humanists, agnostics, freethinkers and other so-called &ldquo;nones.&rdquo;  For many Christians, <b>atheists</b> are <b>viewed</b> as exotic, mysterious, and tabboo. Let&#39;s shine some light on atheism by taking a look at who they thank at <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  <b>Atheists</b> aren&#39;t thankful to imaginary deities; we are thankful to actual people. Not only are we thankful to the loved one in our lives, but we are also thankful to all the people throughout history who have contributed positively to our way of life.  This week millions of American families will gather around <b>Thanksgiving</b> tables full of turkey and trimmings and give thanks to God for His many blessings to our nation and to each of us. But what does an <b>atheist</b> do on this special day, and who does he or she thank for the blessings of this life?  &quot;What we do is thank people,&quot; said Zachary Moore, a 33-year-old <b>atheist</b> in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. &quot;<b>Thanksgiving</b> is like a microcosm of your life, when you can look at who has helped you... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving cake ideas.
