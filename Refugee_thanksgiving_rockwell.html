        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, observed in 2024 on Thursday, November 28, honors a 1621 feast between Plymouth colonists and the Wampanoag people.  That&#39;s why many Native Americans and others mark <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a solemn day of remembrance instead of celebration. Here&#39;s what really went down after the plates were cleared in Plymouth, Mass.  The colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Company, not the Plymouth Colony, decreed a day of <b>thanksgiving</b> for their victory which is often interpreted by modern-day Native Americans as the basis for the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday which many observe as a Day of Mourning and reflection.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a popular North American holiday that is central to the origin story of the United States. It is traditionally said to have begun with the Plymouth <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, but other <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations may have taken place earlier.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> dates to the days of the early American colonists and carries a rich, yet controversial, history. Explore the origins of the holiday. Thanksgiving is the annual holiday that takes place throughout the United States on the last Thursday of November.  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as Spanish and English days of feasting and prayer to become <b>the </b>football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today. English...  The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  Most Americans are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North America. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>Say grace thanksgiving day race wichita ks.
