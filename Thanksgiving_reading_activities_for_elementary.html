        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving reading activities for elementary Dinner prayer thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p><b>추석</b> [Chuseok], also known as the Korean Thanksgiving holidays, is one of the most important cultural holidays in Korea, along with 설날 [Seollal; New Year&rsquo;s Day], in South Korea. It is celebrated on the 15th day (full moon) of the 8th month in the lunar calendar.  <b>Chuseok</b> (추석) &ndash; otherwise known as Hangawi (한가위) by Koreans or as &ldquo;<b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; by Westerners &ndash; is one of the most significant public holidays in <b>Korea</b>, together with Seollal or the <b>Korean</b> New Year (설날).  We are celebrating <b>Chuseok</b>, one of the most important holidays on the Korean calendar and known as Korean <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b>. In this piece, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the dazzling kaleidoscope that is this extraordinary festival.  <b>September</b> <b>17</b>, <b>2024</b> is Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving) in South Korea and this is one of the important traditional festivals for Koreans. Let&rsquo;s talk about some interesting customs about the Korean Chuseok in this blog post.  <b>Chuseok</b> (추석), also known as Hangawi, marks a zenith in the <b>Korean</b> calendar, rivaling only the lunar New Year in its cultural significance. Often likened to <b>Thanksgiving</b>, this festival is observed on the 15th <b>day</b> of the eighth lunar month, typically aligning with September or October by the Gregorian reckoning.  One of the most important traditional holidays is 추석(秋夕) [<b>chu</b>-<b>seok</b>]. It is often referred to as Korean Thanksgiving or Harvest Day.  Chuseok, also known as Korean Thanksgiving Day, is one of the most important and festive holidays of the year. This year, Chuseok falls <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b>, <b>September</b> <b>19th</b>, but the holiday period actually lasts for three days in total &ndash; including the day before and after Chuseok .  <b>Chuseok</b> is a Korean holiday for Koreans to give thanks for the bountiful harvest and to celebrate the abundance of food with family. Because both Thanksgiving Day in other countries and Chuseok celebrate and appreciate the successful harvest, many foreigners consider Chuseok as Korean Thanksgiving Day. What Does &ldquo;Chuseok&rdquo; Mean?  Chusok, <b>Korea</b>&rsquo;s annual <b>thanksgiving</b> holiday, is one of the biggest migration events in modern <b>Korea</b>. Over half of the population visits families and ancestral graves during the three-<b>day</b> holiday, which usually falls sometime in September or October. </p>        <p>Is giant grocery store open on thanksgiving.
