        <h2><strong>Bible verse about giving thanks in all situations Thanksgiving due date</strong></h2>
        <p><b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1941</b>, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day. The Senate, however, amended the resolution establishing the holiday as the fourth Thursday, which would take into account those years when November has five Thursdays.  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1789</b>, President George Washington issued a proclamation naming Thursday, <b>November</b> <b>26</b>, 1789, as an official holiday of &quot;sincere and humble thanks.&quot; The nation then celebrated its first Thanksgiving under its new Constitution.  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1789</b>, George Washington issued his Thanksgiving proclamation, designating for &ldquo;the People of the United States a day of public thanks-giving&rdquo; to be held on &ldquo;Thursday the 26th day of November,&rdquo; 1789, marking the first national celebration of a holiday that has become commonplace in today&rsquo;s households.  After Lincoln&rsquo;s death in 1865, Andrew Johnson&rsquo;s first Thanksgiving proclamation designated the first Thursday <b>in</b> <b>December</b> as a national day of thanksgiving. But for the remainder of his Presidency, he chose the last Thursday in November to celebrate.  This was just the third federal <b>holiday</b> to be <b>declared</b>. Only Independence Day and Washington&rsquo;s birthday are older. <b>Thanksgiving</b> didn&rsquo;t become a <b>national</b> <b>holiday</b> until the height of the Civil War in 1863, when President Lincoln issued a proclamation urging Americans to ask God to &ldquo;heal the wounds of the nation.&rdquo;  Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>28</b>. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag...  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1863</b>, during the Civil War, Lincoln proclaimed a national day of thanksgiving to be celebrated on Thursday, November 26. The holiday was annually proclaimed by every president thereafter, and the date chosen, with few exceptions, was the last Thursday in November.  The First National Proclamation of Thanksgiving was given by the Continental Congress <b>in</b> <b>1777</b> from its temporary location in York, Pennsylvania, while the British occupied the national capital at Philadelphia.  On October 3, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln <b>declared</b> that the last Thursday in November was to be recognized as a Day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> (Obama White House). In 1870, Congress passed legislation making <b>Thanksgiving</b> a <b>holiday</b>, but gave the president discretion to <b>declare</b> the date that the <b>holiday</b> would be celebrated. </p>        <p>Winter break activities rochester ny. <a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/80.html">Thanksgiving leftover frittata</a>.
