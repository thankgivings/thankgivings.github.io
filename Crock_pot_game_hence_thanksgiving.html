It took the Civil War&mdash;and with it the perceived need for a gesture to build national unity&mdash;for Lincoln to declare a day of thanksgiving for the U.S. in <b>October</b> <b>1863</b>, to be celebrated the following month.  In <b>1863</b>, President Abraham Lincoln declared National Thanksgiving Day in the United States, to be held on the last Thursday of each November. The day of celebration, family get-togethers, parades, and feasts that we know today largely came about due to the tireless lobbying of Sarah Josepha Hale.  In the United States, Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in <b>November</b>, as specified in a joint resolution passed by Congress in 1941 and a proclamation issued by President Franklin D.

Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. [2] . Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  As the first President of the United States, George Washington proclaimed the first nationwide thanksgiving celebration in America <b>marking</b> <b>November</b> <b>26</b>, <b>1789</b>, &quot;as a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favours of Almighty God&quot;, [26] and calling on Americans to &quot;unite in ... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving hand and feet turkey.
