        <h2><strong>What did they eat at the original thanksgiving Jackson wisconsin thanksgiving dinners 2024</strong></h2>
        <p>Leading up to Thanksgiving, we saw increased <b>crowds</b> and wait times. But just how many people opt for <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b> over Thanksgiving dinner at grandma&rsquo;s house? Let&rsquo;s check it out. We visited Magic Kingdom this morning to check on the <b>crowds</b> and wait times, and we were surprised! Here is a look at the entrance on Thanksgiving morning.  Here are the Frog Family&rsquo;s best tips for making Thanksgiving at <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b> an enjoyable one! 1. Pick Your Park Wisely. If you&#39;re headed to Thanksgiving at <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b>, you want to pay even closer attention to our Crowd Calendar, so you can pick the best day to visit.  Thanksgiving (November 22-29, 2024; November 21-28, 2025) &ndash; Just about any Walt <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b> fan is familiar with the <b>crowds</b> of the final three weeks on this list. They&rsquo;re hardly a secret or surprise, and are predictably busy year in and year out.  So, let&rsquo;s take a look at <b>crowds</b> on ACTUAL Thanksgiving. Before we set out for the parks, though, we checked <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b>&rsquo;s park pass availability. Surprisingly enough, ALL four parks are still open to theme park guests and those staying at <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b> hotels. Even Annual Passholders had wide-open reservations for all four parks on ...  Veterans Day and <b>Thanksgiving </b>are both popular across Walt <b>Disney World</b>, which means to expect heavy <b>crowds </b>if visiting then. Christmas events usually kick off at Magic Kingdom, look for Mickey&rsquo;s Very Merry Christmas Party to start this month.  Happy Thanksgiving, <b>everyone</b>! We&rsquo;re thankful for a lot this year, and we&rsquo;re celebrating in Disney <b>World</b>. Hello from Disney World! Thanksgiving <b>is</b> <b>notoriously</b> a busy travel day for people across the country. So, how do the crowds compare in Disney <b>World</b>? <b>Come</b> with us to Magic Kingdom to find out!  If you&rsquo;re visiting Walt <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b> for Thanksgiving 2024 and are looking for last-minute restaurant ideas, avoiding holiday <b>crowds</b>, etc., we&rsquo;ve got you covered. Here we answer frequently asked questions, info, and tips for avoiding Thanksgiving week <b>crowds</b>.  We rated Magic Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, EPCOT, and Animal Kingdom <b>crowd</b> levels as Massive <b>Crowds</b>, Above Normal Crowds, Normal Crowds, Below Normal Crowds, and Very Low Crowds. Here are the color schemes to identify those levels on the calendar.  With mild temps, holiday decor, and not-as-busy-as-other-holidays <b>crowds</b>, spending Thanksgiving at Disney <b>World</b> <b>is</b> a great idea for many people. Here&rsquo;s some advice, including where to spend your Thanksgiving meal and how to handle the crowds. </p>        <p>Airtime for charlie brown thanksgiving special.
