        <h2><strong>What is the true origin of thanksgiving Thanksgiving pilgrim hats cookies</strong></h2>
        <p>Chuseok is commonly incorrectly translated as &quot;<b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; in American English despite the holidays being vastly different in origin and celebration. [8][9] Although most South Koreans visit their families and ancestral homes, there are festivities held at the National Folk Museum of <b>Korea</b>.  Here are a couple of phrases, using <b>Korean</b> letters, and the translated English phrase: &quot;추석 연휴 잘 보내세요. (Have a great Chuseok holiday)&quot; &quot;해피 추석 되세요. (<b>Happy</b> Chuseok)!&quot; However, Schroepfer explains...  Chuseok (추석), also known as Hangawi, marks a zenith in the Korean calendar, rivaling only the lunar New Year in its cultural significance. Often likened to Thanksgiving, this festival is observed on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, typically aligning with September or October by the Gregorian reckoning.  Knowing how to say &lsquo;<b>Happy</b> Chuseok&rsquo; in <b>Korea</b> is important since people exchange many Chuseok greetings to each other in <b>Korea</b>. 1- 즐거운 한가위 보내세요. Jeulgeoun hangawi bonaeseyo. I hope you have a <b>Happy</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. 즐거운[jeulgeoun] &ndash; pleasant 한가위 [hangawi] &ndash; <b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, aka 추석 [Chuseok]  We are celebrating Chuseok, one of the most important holidays on the <b>Korean</b> calendar and known as <b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day. In this piece, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the dazzling kaleidoscope that is this extraordinary festival.  Today we&rsquo;re going to introduce you to Chuseok 추석, or as people like to call it &ndash; <b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Chuseok, along with Seollal (설날), is one of the biggest traditional holidays in South Korea .  How to Say &ldquo;<b>Happy</b> Chuseok&rdquo; in <b>Korean</b>? On Seollal, &ldquo;새해 복 많이 받으세요 /sae-hae bok ma-ni ba-deu-se-yo/&rdquo; is the traditional greeting. But, there are no specific greetings for Chuseok. The most common Chuseok greeting would be &ldquo;추석 잘 보내세요 /chu-seok jal bo-nae-se-yo/,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;have a good Chuseok.&rdquo;  The very basic way to wish someone is <b>Jeulgeoun</b> <b>hangawi</b> <b>bonaeseyo</b> (즐거운 한가위 보내세요) which translates as &lsquo;I wish that you have a very happy thanksgiving&rsquo;. Korean greetings sound very sweet and always leave a smile on your face. Chuseok Day or Hangawi is a national holiday in South Korea.  Chuseok (추석) &ndash; otherwise known as Hangawi (한가위) by Koreans or as &ldquo;Korean Thanksgiving&rdquo; by Westerners &ndash; is one of the most significant public holidays in Korea, together with Seollal or the Korean New Year (설날). </p>        <p><a href="./609.html">Free thanksgiving scripts</a>. <a href="./849.html">Thanksgiving dinner overland park ks</a>.
