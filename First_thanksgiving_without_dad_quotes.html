        <h2><strong>First thanksgiving without dad quotes When did macy start opening on thanksgiving day parade</strong></h2>
        <p>The first Thanksgiving in Canada has been credited to English <b>explorer</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b>. According to historical records, he celebrated in 1578 in what we now know as Newfoundland. The first official Thanksgiving was celebrated on Nov. 6, 1879.  Many of the trappings of Canadian Thanksgiving are similar to those of its U.S. counterpart, but the Canadian tradition belongs to the <b>16th</b> <b>century</b>, more than four decades before the historic...  It is said that the first annual Canadian Thanksgiving was celebrated on 6 November <b>1879</b>. <b>Sir</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> and his crew are credited as the first Europeans to have celebrated a Thanksgiving ceremony in North America, close to Nunavut in 1578. They ate a meal of salt beef, biscuits and mushy peas to celebrate their safe arrival.  On January 31, <b>1957</b>, the Canadian Parliament proclaimed: A Day of General Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed &ndash; to be observed on the 2nd Monday in October. English explorer Martin Frobisher hosted the first Canadian Thanksgiving.  When and why has <b>Thanksgiving</b> been observed in <b>Canada</b>? The <b>first</b> national <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> was celebrated in the Province of <b>Canada</b> in 1859. It was organized at the behest of leaders of the Protestant clergy, who appropriated the holiday of American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which was <b>first</b> observed in 1777 and established as a national day of ...  While <b>Thanksgiving</b> wasn&#39;t declared a national holiday in <b>Canada</b> until 1879, the <b>first</b> Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is recognized as happening as far back as 1578. English explorer Martin Frobisher and his crew were looking for a Northwest Passage, and after a series of storms in the Arctic, the fleet came back together in what is now Newfoundland, <b>Canada</b>.  Those of <b>us</b> from the <b>United States</b> might think we hold the patent on the concept of <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Indeed, the November observance is one of the two biggest quintessential <b>U.S</b>. holidays. (The Fourth of July is the other.) But the idea is by no means unique, nor did the iconic 1621 gathering of Pilgrims and Native Americans come <b>first</b>.  English <b>explorer</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> and his crew had the first Canadian Thanksgiving in 1578. As the story goes, in 1578, English explorer Martin Frobisher and his crew gave thanks and communion was observed, either on land at Frobisher Bay, in present day Nunavut, or onboard a ship anchored there.  The first-ever Canadian Thanksgiving happened in 1578 when English explorer <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> and his crew gave thanks for surviving their dangerous journey to the Arctic. Meanwhile, the United States didn&rsquo;t get in on the action until 1621, when the Pilgrims and Native Americans had a feast in Plymouth, Massachusetts. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving kid song lyrics.
