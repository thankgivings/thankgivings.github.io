        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving day activities in atlanta The first thanksgiving for pilgrims</strong></h2>
        <p>From the food to who was in attendance, here are the details about the origin of one of our favorite holidays. <b>Thanksgiving</b> dates back to <b>1621</b> in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  For American culture, <b>the </b>story of <b>the </b>Pilgrims, including their &ldquo;<b>first Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; feast with <b>the </b>local Native Americans, has become <b>the </b>ruling creation narrative, celebrated each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games.  When Americans rediscovered Winslow&#39;s account in 1822, the unremarkable harvest feast of <b>1621</b> was elevated to become the <b>&ldquo;First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; 6 By that time, American <b>Thanksgiving</b> practices had come to resemble that earlier feast.  Who Was at the First Thanksgiving? Guests at the feast included <b>90</b> <b>Wampanoag</b> <b>Indians</b> from a nearby village, including their leader Massasoit. One of these Indians, a young man named Squanto, spoke fluent English and had been appointed by Massasoit to serve as the pilgrim&rsquo;s translator and guide.  <b>In </b>1620, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on <b>the </b>Mayflower for <b>the </b>&quot;New World&quot; and landed <b>in </b>modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by <b>the </b>Wampanoag people.  after that &quot;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; - the Fortune arrived in November of <b>1621</b>. One of the passengers on the Fortune, William Hilton, wrote a letter home that November. Although he was not present at that &quot;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&quot; he does mention turkeys. The letter of William Hilton, passenger on the Fortune (The letter was written in November of <b>1621</b>)  More than 100 people attended. The <b>Wampanoag</b> <b>Indians</b> who attended the first Thanksgiving had occupied the land for thousands of years and were key to the survival of the colonists during the...  The 50 remaining colonists and roughly 90 <b>Wampanoag</b> <b>tribesmen</b> attended the &quot;First Thanksgiving.&quot; The major similarity between the first Jamestown settlers and the first Plymouth settlers was great human suffering.  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the first recorded religious Thanksgiving Day in <b>Plymouth</b> happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion, the... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving day activities in atlanta. When was thanksgiving this year. Whos serving thanksgiving dinner near me. Best movies thanksgiving weekend.
