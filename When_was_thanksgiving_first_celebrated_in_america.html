        <h2><strong>When was thanksgiving first celebrated in america August new orleans thanksgiving menu</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Do</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Despite the holidays having the same name in English, however, <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Germany</b> is not a big day for family gatherings and feasting - which are typically reserved for Christmas.  Today, Thanksgiving is celebrated in many parts of <b>Germany</b>, with customs and traditions that are unique to each region. From parades and feasts to gift-giving and charity events, Thanksgiving has become a beloved holiday in Germany that brings people together to give thanks and celebrate the harvest season.  Germany has its own <b>Thanksgiving </b>celebration called &ldquo;Erntedankfest&rdquo;. In many Germany communities festivities include parades with floats and marching bands.  While Thanksgiving <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>celebrated</b> in <b>Germany</b> as it is in the United States, there are still various ways in which Germans observe this global tradition. Let&rsquo;s explore how Germans embrace the spirit of gratitude and harvest season in their own special way.  Today, the <b>German</b> tradition of Erntedank is mainly a religious holiday. While there are some slight differences in the exact date of Erntedank, celebrations, church services, and parades are usually held the first Sunday of November. Erntedank still pays tribute to the work accomplished in <b>Germany</b>&rsquo;s fields and gardens.  The Harvest Festival in <b>Germany</b> is similar&mdash;but not identical&mdash;to <b>Thanksgiving</b> in the United States. It&rsquo;s a holiday to <b>celebrate</b> the autumn Ernte (&ldquo;harvest&rdquo;), as well as show appreciation to God and people working in Landwirtschaft (&ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;).  In <b>Germany</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b>&mdash; (&ldquo;das Erntedankfest,&rdquo; i.e.,<b>Thanksgiving</b> Harvest Festival)&mdash;is strongly entrenched in <b>German</b> culture. Erntedankfest is usually observed on the first Sunday of October (04 October 2015 this year), although the timing is not hard and fast nationwide.  While Erntedankfest is the equivalent of the <b>Thanksgiving </b>Holiday in the United States and Canada, the German festivity is a religious celebration. And long before the first Europeans arrived in North America, farmers across Europe held celebrations at harvest time.  Per the recommendation of the German Catholic Church, German Thanksgiving Day is typically observed on the <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> in <b>October</b>. But the exact date of festivities varies from region to region. For example, the Swiss and Austrians usually celebrate Erntedank in mid-September. </p>        <p>Trip advisor thanksgiving dinner.
