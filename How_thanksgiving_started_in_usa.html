        <h2><strong>How thanksgiving started in usa Thanksgiving dinner stockbridge ma</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Canada</b> celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> decades before the <b>Pilgrims</b>, but the holiday in the U.S. and its northern neighbor have much in common.  <b>Canada</b> celebrates <b>Thanksgiving</b> every second <b>Monday</b> of October. The celebration, as we know it today, keeps the essence of being grateful for a bountiful harvest received. It also mirrors deep faith and gratitude to a supreme being that protects, blesses, and listens to every citizen&#39;s prayers.  Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> predates American <b>Thanksgiving</b> by over 40 years, before the 1621 arrival of the <b>Pilgrims</b> who brought new <b>Thanksgiving</b> traditions to the US. The <b>Pilgrims</b>, English colonists, permanently settled in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  Celebrating <b>Thanksgiving</b> in Canada holds deep cultural significance. <b>Pilgrims</b> arriving in Massachusets. <b>Thanksgiving</b> finds its origins in the 17th century. In 1620, a group of religious separatists left England to establish a colony in the New World.  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its celebration here in <b>Canada</b>, given that we will all be celebrating on October 14 th. We all learned as children about the American Thanksgiving myth of the first US Thanksgiving but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is an official statutory holiday in all provinces and territories except Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. It is called Action de gr&acirc;ce in Quebec and is celebrated to a much lesser extent there than in the rest of the country, given the holiday&rsquo;s Protestant origins and Anglo-nationalist associations.  Canadian Thanksgiving takes place on the second Monday <b>in</b> <b>October</b>, while American Thanksgiving falls on the fourth Thursday of November. Canada&rsquo;s celebration has often been credited to it...  American <b>Thanksgiving</b> is connected to the 1621 feast between Native Americans and <b>Pilgrims</b>, while the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> can be dated back to 1578 in Canada. We celebrated our first <b>Thanksgiving</b> with a delicious meal of biscuits, salt beef, and mushy peas.  Here is how Canada celebrates their big holiday as well as four ways that the Canadian and U.S. Thanksgivings differ. 1. Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is in October&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian Thanksgiving happens a full month and a half before American Thanksgiving, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024). </p>        <p>Which president made thanksgiving the third thursday of november.
