        <p>Fellini&rsquo;s Pizzeria serves its special <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Pizza</b> the day before the holiday every year, inspiring long lines, pre-orders months in advance, and lots of happy diners.  The DiGiorno <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>pizza</b> is a limited-time item that can only be purchased online. Each Wednesday at 12 p.m. EST, new batches of the <b>pizza</b> go up for sale on the company&#39;s site.

From savory butter chicken flavors to cheesy paneer tikka delights, there is a <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>pizza</b> for everyone.  Happy <b>Thanksgiving</b> everyone! What does today look like for you? For some, it may look pretty normal &ndash; the turkey smells delicious, the pumpkin pies are warm out of the oven and family and friends are gathered near while the sounds of chatting and laughter fill the air. The joy and thankfulness are palpable.  <b>PIZZA</b> CRUST: For a crispy <b>pizza</b> (especially on the bottom), I suggest using a <b>pizza</b> pan with holes to allow the crust to bake through nicely. Check out my Amazon Shop for a great option! STORAGE: Leftover <b>pizza</b> is best kept tightly wrapped in foil paper, refrigerated for 3-4 days for optimal freshness.
