        <h2><strong>Free and printable template for charitable donations for thanksgiving Thanksgiving turkey for dummies</strong></h2>
        <p>Turkey <b>was not</b> the centerpiece of the meal, as it is today, explains Wall. Though it is possible the colonists and American Indians cooked wild turkey, she suspects that goose or duck was the ...  However, many of the <b>foods</b> we associate with a traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner actually weren&rsquo;t available for the <b>first</b> feast, which stretched for three days. So <b>what foods</b> were served <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes.  When the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag shared the first Thanksgiving in <b>1621</b>, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>, and <b>turkey</b> were missing from the table.  The Pilgrims and Wampanoag shared a harvest feast, but it didn&#39;t happen the way you were likely taught in school. Every November, Americans gather around the table to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> in ...  What <b>Wasn</b>&#39;<b>t</b> Served at the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. It is also worth noting what was not present at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>feast</b>. There were no cloudlike heaps of mashed <b>potatoes</b>, since white potatoes had not yet crossed over from South America.  Turkey likely wasn&#39;t on the table at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, but it eventually became the featured dish, thanks in part to an 1827 novel.  The Pilgrims and Wampanoag tribe members enjoyed squash <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621 in Plymouth colony. The Narragansett tribe called the <b>food</b> &ldquo;askutasquash,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;<b>eaten</b> raw,&rdquo; said Trinklein. While squash did <b>not</b> make a great <b>first</b> impression with early settlers, it eventually became a staple of colonial cuisine, he said.  What They (Likely) Did Have at the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. <b>Venison</b>; Fowl (geese <b>and</b> duck) Corn; Nuts (<b>walnuts</b>, <b>chestnuts</b>, <b>beechnuts</b>) Shellfish; So venison was a major ingredient, as well as fowl, but that likely included geese and ducks. Turkeys are a possibility, but were not a common food in that time. Pilgrims grew onions and herbs.  Although what was grown in those gardens isn&rsquo;t mentioned by name in historical documents, later sources <b>suggest</b> <b>turnips</b>, <b>carrots</b>, <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> might have been available to cook with and eat for the first Thanksgiving meal. </p>        <p>Capital grille thanksgiving hours.
