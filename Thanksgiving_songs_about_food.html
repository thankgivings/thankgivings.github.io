        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving songs about food Thanksgiving casserole stuffing</strong></h2>
        <p>While not an inherently religious holiday, <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration has caused debate within the <b>Jewish</b> community and illuminates the delicate balance that American <b>Jews</b> hold between their <b>Jewish</b> and American identities.  Did you know that <b>Thanksgiving</b> is really a <b>Jewish</b> holiday? Although <b>Thanksgiving</b> is not on the <b>Jewish</b> calendar, historians believe that Sukkot may have inspired America&rsquo;s favorite farewell...  As Jews, we always look to the <b>Torah</b> for a deeper perspective. What light does the Torah shed on the wonderful trait of thankfulness? And then there is Thanksgiving. The day when we thank G‑d for enabling all the above&mdash;and for all else He does for us.  If we only take the time to say a few words of <b>thanksgiving</b> to God, whether for bringing the family together or for giving us the food on our plates, we can make <b>Thanksgiving</b> have <b>Jewish</b> meaning.  The first and most significant issue in discussing whether it is halachic [acceptable according to <b>Jewish</b> law] to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> is whether it is permissible to eat a <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal, with the classical foods that American tradition indicates one should eat at this meal: turkey and cranberry sauce. Among the authorities of the ...  There are strong historical connections between Judaism and Thanksgiving. Most of the Pilgrims who celebrated the first Thanksgiving were <b>Puritans</b>, a branch of the Protestant faith. The Puritans strongly identified with the historical traditions and customs of the Israelites in the Bible.  By drawing on Jewish values of hospitality and justice, we can view <b>Thanksgiving</b> as more than a day of feasting&mdash;it becomes a sacred opportunity to reconnect, express gratitude, and honor our shared responsibility to each other.  Chanukah was declared a <b>Jewish</b> national holiday 2178 years ago. <b>Thanksgiving</b> was declared a national American holiday on the last Thursday of every November by Abraham Lincoln in 1863. Before then, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was celebrated on different dates in different states, so we won&rsquo;t count those.  With its focus on gathering as a community, giving thanks, and being mindful, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is infused with central <b>Jewish</b> values. We return to these themes again and again throughout <b>Jewish</b> practice, whether in prayer services, through the study of Torah, or as the basis for mitzvot. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving printables and crafts.
