        <p>It wasn&rsquo;t until November 19, <b>1963</b>, only three days before his assassination, that John F. Kennedy decided to take pity on a 55-pound turkey that had been affixed with a sign labeled &ldquo;Good <b>Eating</b>, Mr. President!&rdquo; Kennedy responded with a smile: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just let this one grow. It&rsquo;s our Thanksgiving present to him.&rdquo;  In addition to serving a traditional turkey dinner, <b>White</b> House Thanksgiving <b>meals</b> have featured regional items such as Chesapeake Bay oysters, rockfish from the Potomac River, terrapin from Maryland&rsquo;s Eastern Shore, cranberries from Cape Cod, and mince and pumpkin pies.  Thanksgiving at the White House is a quiet holiday for the president&#39;s <b>family</b>, featuring a meal that traditionally included turkey, Chesapeake Bay oysters, rockfish from the Potomac, terrapin from the Eastern shore, cranberries from Cape Cod, and mince and pumpkin pies.

But Kennedy, for whatever reason, said, &quot;We&#39;ll just let this one grow.&quot; The L.A.

Kennedy decided to send back the Thanksgiving turkey that had arrived at the <b>White</b> House, saying it should grow. Kennedy never formally granted the ...  And that was the original intent &ndash; a gift for the presidential holiday table&hellip; and for Big Turkey to get attention and remind people to <b>eat</b> turkey for Thanksgiving, of course. There&rsquo;s a story that suggests Abraham Lincoln was the first to let a turkey go because his son took a liking to it, but the <b>White</b> House Historical Association says ...
