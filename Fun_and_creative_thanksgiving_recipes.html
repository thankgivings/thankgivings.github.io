        <h2><strong>Fun and creative thanksgiving recipes Thanksgiving blessing friend</strong></h2>
        <p>In this article I take a brief look at the origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its celebration here in <b>Canada</b>, given that we will all be celebrating on October 14th. We all learned as children about the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> myth of the first US <b>Thanksgiving</b> but what of the <b>early</b> Canadian celebrations.  According to some historians, the earliest celebration in Canada is attributed <b>to</b> <b>Sir</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b>, an English privateer, who, in 1578, participated in a feast of thanksgiving with his crew in present-day Nunavut (Newfoundland) to celebrate their safe passage to the New World.  So in this blog post, I&rsquo;m going to talk about why we celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b>, what distinguishes Canadian and American Thanksgiving, and what the holiday has to do with how we remember and forget our collective histories.  &ldquo;In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thanksgiving in Canada was mainly <b>a</b> <b>Protestant</b> <b>endeavor</b> and was often used as an excuse to give thanks for the British monarchy &ndash; factors that...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  Though <b>Canada</b> does have a first <b>Thanksgiving</b> story analogous to the U.S. story of the feast at Plymouth in 1621 &mdash; it involves the pirate/explorer Martin Frobisher giving thanks in 1578 for a...  It is thought that one reason for the timing of Canadian Thanksgiving being so much earlier than American Thanksgiving is because Canada <b>is</b> <b>further</b> <b>north</b>, and they celebrate the Fall Harvest earlier in the year.  English explorer Martin Frobisher and his crew had the first Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1578. As the story goes, in 1578, English explorer Martin Frobisher and his crew gave thanks and communion was observed, either on land at Frobisher Bay, in present day Nunavut, or onboard a ship anchored there.  <b>Canada</b> celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> decades before the Pilgrims, but the holiday in the U.S. and its northern neighbor have much in common.
