        <h2><strong>New side dishes to make for thanksgiving Road trip travel safely during thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Although making <b>the turkey</b> ahead takes just as much time to prepare, it requires very little time on <b>the day</b> of your holiday meal. Spreading out the <b>cooking</b> over several days and making as much ahead as possible are the best ways I know to have a low-stress, relaxing <b>Thanksgiving</b> or holiday meal.  It&rsquo;s easy: Simply <b>cook</b> it a <b>day</b> or two in advance, let it cool completely, then carve the bird into large pieces&mdash;breasts, wings, thighs and drumsticks. Store in a container in the refrigerator until the big <b>day</b>. This method actually result in juicier meat&mdash;and an infinitely more relaxed host.  1. After the turkey is roasted (white and dark meat) cover loosely with foil and let sit for 1-2 hours BEFORE refrigerating. 2. Refrigerate whole pieces, DO NOT SLICE YET 3. Thanksgiving day: Remove from refrigerator about <b>30</b> &ndash; 45 minutes before slicing. 4. Slice ONLY what you will need for the day. 5.  Cooking a turkey <b>the</b> day before Thanksgiving <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be the traditional route, but it can be a smart and practical choice. Preparing the bird in advance allows you to free up valuable oven space on the big day and gives you ample time to focus on other side dishes and desserts.  With this technique, <b>cooking</b> turkey the <b>day</b> before, the week before, or even the month before, still tastes delicious and freshly carved. Of all the easy Thanksgiving turkey recipes out there, this one just works.  Don&rsquo;t want to worry about roasting a whole turkey on <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Whole turkey or turkey breast can be roasted and carved ahead and reheats beautifully with these easy instructions. No one will ever know you didn&rsquo;t cook it right before serving!  <b>Yes</b>, you can absolutely cook a turkey the day before and reheat it.
