        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving chicago suburbs What is the date of next years thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Traditional <b>foods</b> have evolved since those early days, but plenty of indigenous crops will grace our <b>Thanksgiving</b> tables this year. If corn chips with salsa are out before dinner, the peppers and tomatoes in the salsa are Native American <b>foods</b>. For those who like guacamole dip, avocados are another native <b>food</b>.  What was the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>food</b>? Find out what was served at the very first Thanksgiving (and what wasn&#39;t) from wildfowl to produce.  So what <b>foods</b> were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  The first Thanksgiving was mostly a <b>guys</b>-<b>only</b> <b>event</b> where the English women, says Beahrs &quot;were likely doing the bulk of the cooking.&quot; Was it held indoors? Around a big table?  The meal shared by pilgrims and the Wampanoag tribe more than 400 years ago didn&#39;t have much in common with the national holiday that we celebrate today. In fact, it wasn&#39;t until <b>1870</b> that Congress declared Thanksgiving a holiday. So which foods were actually eaten during the first Thanksgiving?  So how did the Thanksgiving menu evolve into what it is today? Wall explains that the Thanksgiving holiday, as we know it, took root in the <b>mid</b>-<b>19th</b> <b>century</b>.  Based on the few historical documents available, including a letter sent home by a colonist, the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> included deer (venison), wildfowl, cod, bass, and a type of multi-colored corn called flint.  From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  When you picture the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, you probably imagine a table piled high with turkey, stuffing, and pie. But what if I told you the real meal back in 1621 was way different?
