        <h2><strong>Lakeside mall open thanksgiving day Www.kidsdomain.com thanksgiving word search</strong></h2>
        <p>In this article I take a brief look at the origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its celebration here in <b>Canada</b>, given that we will all be celebrating on October 14th. We all learned as children about the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> myth of the first US <b>Thanksgiving</b> but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  Today Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is held on the second Monday of October every year, or at least it has been since Canadian Parliament declared it so on January 31, 1957. Before this, <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> had been held sporadically, often coinciding with other major events and anniversaries.  As in the United States, <b>Canada</b> observed occasional Thanksgivings to <b>celebrate</b> important events such as the end of the War of 1812. And like its neighbor, <b>Canada</b>&rsquo;s first thanksgivings tended...  Here is how <b>Canada </b>celebrates their big holiday as well as four ways that the Canadian and U.S. Thanksgivings differ. 1. Canadian <b>Thanksgiving </b>is in October&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian <b>Thanksgiving </b>happens a full month and a half before American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  When and why has Thanksgiving been observed in <b>Canada</b>? The first national Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated in the Province of Canada in 1859.  So if American Thanksgiving comes from a historical event, why do Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving? It may be surprising to hear that Canadian Thanksgiving <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> <b>southern</b> <b>counterpart</b>&#39;<b>s</b> <b>celebration</b>.  What&#39;s the difference between Thanksgiving in America and Thanksgiving in Canada? In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b> but in Canada, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.).  Since 1957, Canadian Thanksgiving has been celebrated on the second Monday of <b>October</b>. This change was made to separate the celebration of the harvest from the Remembrance Day commemorations of Canadian War veterans held in November.  Why Do We Celebrate? Canadian Thanksgiving is rooted in <b>Indigenous</b> <b>values</b>, including giving thanks for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. First Nations traditions would include feasting, prayer, dance and other ceremonies. </p>        <p>Are banks in canada open on the u.s thanksgiving. Thanksgiving center activities 2nd grade.
