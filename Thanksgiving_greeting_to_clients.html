        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving greeting to clients Angry kid ruins thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>How <b>did</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> become a national <b>holiday</b>? Sarah Josepha Hale campaigned for a national <b>thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b> in the United States during the 19th century, eventually winning President Abraham Lincoln &rsquo;s support in 1863.  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday&#39;s</b> history in North America is rooted in English traditions dating from the Protestant Reformation. It also has aspects of a harvest festival, even though the harvest in New England occurs well before the late-November date on which the modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b> is celebrated. [1] [2]  Learn the history and origin of <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, including the symbols related to the <b>holiday</b> and facts about the Presidential Proclamation.  President James Madison proclaimed a day of Thanksgiving to be held on April 13, <b>1815</b>, the last such proclamation issued by a President until Abraham Lincoln did so in 1862. Most of the credit for the establishment of an annual Thanksgiving holiday may be given to Sarah Josepha Hale.  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of <b>Plymouth</b> Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as <b>Spanish</b> and English days of feasting and prayer to become the football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today. English...  This was just the third federal <b>holiday</b> to be declared. Only Independence Day and Washington&rsquo;s birthday are older. <b>Thanksgiving</b> didn&rsquo;t become a national <b>holiday</b> until the height of the Civil War in 1863, when President Lincoln issued a proclamation urging Americans to ask God to &ldquo;heal the wounds of the nation.&rdquo;  Every autumn, Canadian and American families gather for a day centred around community, food and giving thanks &ndash; the day of <b>Thanksgiving</b>. <b>Where did</b> this <b>holiday</b> <b>come</b> from and how is it celebrated today?  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal <b>holiday</b> in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the Canadian <b>holiday</b> of the same name and related celebrations in other regions. </p>        <p>Cool appetizers for thanksgiving.
