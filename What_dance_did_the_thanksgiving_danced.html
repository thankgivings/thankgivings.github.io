It&#39;s typically celebrated in certain regions of Italy in the <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>September</b>. It&#39;s a time to be grateful for a wonderful harvest season. In Italy, expressing gratitude is an art form, and the language reflects this sentiment. To wish someone a Happy Thanksgiving, you&#39;d say &quot;Buon Ringraziamento.&quot;  Harvest celebrations and days of <b>thanksgiving</b> in <b>Europe</b> date back to pre-Christian pagan times. Long before the first Europeans arrived in North America, farmers across Europe held celebrations at harvest time to give thanks for their good fortune and the abundant harvest of the year.
