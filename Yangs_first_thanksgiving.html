        <p><b>Circle</b> Time. It&rsquo;s easy to build skills through <b>activities</b> that are done at <b>circle</b> time! I created a printable (available below) of a turkey with rainbow feathers. I handed each of our toddlers and <b>preschoolers</b> a feather and we called out the name of each color as we placed them on the turkey. You can see snippets of it in this video.
