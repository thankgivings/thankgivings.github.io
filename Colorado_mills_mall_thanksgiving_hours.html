        <h2><strong>Colorado mills mall thanksgiving hours Why serve turkey on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> &amp; Chanukah are both deep narratives in a nation&rsquo;s collective consciousness. That&rsquo;s Chanukah, as well: a narrative deeply embedded in the collective Jewish psyche of how we fought back against religious oppression in our own land, earned our freedom, and thanked Gâ€‘d for the miracles.  Thanksgivukkah is a holiday name portmanteau neologism given to the convergence of the American holiday of Thanksgiving and the first day (and second night) of the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah on Thursday, <b>November</b> 28, 2013.  The phenomenon that is Thanksgivukkah will occur this year on <b>Nov</b>. <b>28</b>, when both Thanksgiving and Hanukkah converge into one big mega-holiday. This combination of festivities has not happened...  The quirk of Thanksgivukkah is that the Hebrew calendar, which follows the sun and the moon, and the Gregorian calendar, where <b>Thanksgiving</b> sits on the fourth Thursday of November, has aligned this year so that the two holidays are on the same day for the first <b>time</b> since 1888, 25 years after President Abraham Lincoln declared <b>Thanksgiving</b> a ...  Some of our older readers have already celebrated <b>Hanukkah</b> on Thanksgiving, and our younger readers may do so again, despite widespread Internet hoaxes claiming this has never happened before, or that it will not do so for 79,811 years:  Rabbi Mendell Lifshitz, Director of the Chabad Jewish Center said for America to have a full entire <b>Hanukkah</b> and <b>Thanksgiving</b> crossing each other, another 70,000 years will have to pass. Since this is a very rare incident, many American Jews have taken this opportunity to memorialize the day.  As it happens, <b>November</b> <b>28th</b> is the latest Thanksgiving can be and the earliest Hanukkah can be. The Gregorian calendar has Thanksgiving hitting the same date once every 7 years.  This year&#39;s alignment has given rise to a curious new amalgam: Thanksgivukkah. The term was coined, <b>and </b>trademarked, by a marketing specialist called Dana Gitell, who teamed up with an online...  In a rare holiday phenomenon, Chanukah and Thanksgiving overlap this year&mdash;for the first time since 1918. Chanukah begins on the evening <b>of</b> <b>Wednesday</b>, <b>Nov</b>. <b>27</b>, with the second night of candle-lighting, for many Jewish Americans, taking place over a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. </p>        <p>Are apple stores open on thanksgiving.
