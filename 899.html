        <h2><strong>Food served at the first thanksgiving meal Thanksgiving dinners thunder bay</strong></h2>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what the Pilgrims ate at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving <b>meal</b>.  Since the historic <b>meal</b> in 1621, <b>Thanksgiving</b> traditions have changed and evolved with American culture. From turkey and stuffing to potatoes and pies, we know what dishes to expect at our holiday tables today, but you might be surprised to learn what <b>foods</b> the Pilgrims and Wampanoag brought to the table and what didn&rsquo;t make the cut.  What Was on the Menu at the First Thanksgiving? Traditional Thanksgiving dinner includes <b>turkey</b>, stuffing and mashed potatoes but the First Thanksgiving likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge...  What was the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>food</b>? Find out what was served at the <b>very</b> first <b>Thanksgiving</b> (and what wasn&#39;t) from wildfowl to produce.  As the weather turns colder, making a hearty batch of stew is a great way to incorporate numerous seasonal ingredients in one dish &mdash; plus it feeds a crowd. &quot;Sobaheg&quot; means stew in the Wampanoag <b>language</b>, and there&#39;s a good chance it was served as part of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>meal</b>.  So what <b>foods</b> were <b>served</b> <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden <b>meal</b> but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  <b>Turkey</b>, <b>corn</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> are all Thanksgiving staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the first Thanksgiving? The answer might surprise you!  From <b>seafood</b> to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the first Thanksgiving probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  For most people, <b>enjoying</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, apple <b>pie</b>. But how did the Pilgrims really... </p>        <p><a href="./224.html">Playerstation thanksgiving discount code</a>. Thanksgiving uk wikipedia. Thanksgiving kitty wallpaper.
