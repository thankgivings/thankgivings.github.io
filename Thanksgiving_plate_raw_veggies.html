        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving plate raw veggies Thanksgiving traffic patterns</strong></h2>
        <p>Taking in the vibrant fall foliage of <b>Canada</b> is a favorite pastime, as are other outdoor pursuits like hiking and fishing. Canadian Football League supporters should plan to devote at least some of their weekend to watching the <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Classic games.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in <b>Canada</b> has been a holiday on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> since 1957. It is a chance for people to give thanks for a good harvest and other fortunes in the past year.  Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving on the second Monday in <b>October</b>, while Thanksgiving in the United States is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November. When is Thanksgiving in Canada? In 2025, Thanksgiving in Canada is Monday, October 13.  Today, <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> is a public holiday and is celebrated with great enthusiasm across the country. Indigenous households are reclaiming the holiday and practicing Indigenous gratitude instead of the holiday now known as Thanksgiving.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (Action de gr&acirc;ce), or <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day (Jour d&rsquo;action de gr&acirc;ce) is an annual Canadian holiday, occurring on the second Monday in October, which celebrates the harvest and other blessings of the past year.  Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a celebration deeply ingrained in the nation&rsquo;s history and culture. It pays homage to the explorers and settlers who ventured into the unknown, as well as the bountiful harvests that have sustained Canadians for centuries.  What Does <b>Thanksgiving</b> Mean Today? While it originally celebrated harvests, today it&rsquo;s about giving thanks for all the good in our lives. It&rsquo;s a non-religious holiday that fosters inclusivity across cultures and beliefs. <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> embodies a spirit of unity and gratitude.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> was first observed as an annual event in <b>Canada</b> on 6 November 1879. The date for each of the following years, as well as a unifying theme for which to give thanks (usually concerning the harvest, though anniversaries related to the British monarchy were also common), was determined annually by Parliament .  Today Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is held on the second Monday of October every year, or at least it has been since Canadian Parliament declared it so on January 31, 1957. Before this, Thanksgiving in Canada had been held sporadically, often coinciding with other major events and anniversaries. </p>        <p><i>Thanksgiving plate raw veggies</i>. <a href="./999.html">Kmart 2024 thanksgiving communication problem</a>.
