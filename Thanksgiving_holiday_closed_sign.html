        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving holiday closed sign New orleans saints record on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Focus on the 300-year gap between the year the image was created and the events it depicts; ask <b>students</b> to explain whether or not the painting should be considered an <b>accurate</b> source of information about <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, and why.  The project includes an <b>accurate</b> telling of &quot;The Plymouth <b>Thanksgiving</b> Story&quot; along with study and discussion questions, ideas for enrichment, art projects, and authentic recipes&mdash;all intended to enable teachers to accurately portray the events surrounding the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  Students who engage with this text will be exposed to a more inclusive look at <b>history</b> and gain insight into how some of the common themes and issues associated with <b>Thanksgiving</b> have no factual <b>historical</b> basis but were invented or made up over the years.  This article about the <b>history</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> from Hess Un-Academy includes several ideas for planning a <b>Thanksgiving</b> Unit Study. The ideas include Native American recipes, STEM activities, ways to focus on gratitude, book suggestions, and Thanksgiving-themed spelling words.  Learn how <b>Thanksgiving</b> became a national holiday. Each educational video on the <b>history</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is paired with three extension activities to use in your classroom.  The Real Story of <b>Thanksgiving</b> would be useful for U.S. <b>History</b>, American Culture, and Social Studies courses. It is appropriate for 6th grade and above. Families may want to watch this program...  1. Ask students what they know about the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. List students&rsquo; ideas on the board. Do students know the names of the groups who feasted together? Do they know where it happened? 2. Tell students they will complete an online game to learn all about the history of the first Thanksgiving. Read objectives:  Students will research the <b>history</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> based on the perspective of the Native Americans and the Pilgrims and then interview each other to learn about each story. <b>Grade</b> Level: 4 - <b>6th</b> Subject:  Teach students about this period in American <b>history</b> with <b>Thanksgiving</b> activities, resources, lesson plans, and teaching ideas about the voyage of the Mayflower, the daily life of the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag, and the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. </p>        <p><a href="./610.html">Thanksgiving greetings to friends and family</a>.
