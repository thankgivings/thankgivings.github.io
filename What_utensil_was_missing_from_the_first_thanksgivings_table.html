        <p>Instead of having turkey and mashed potatoes, Liberians celebrate their Thanksgiving Day eating mashed cassava, chicken, jollof rice and other typical food from West <b>Africa</b>. SOURCE: TRAVEL NOIRE. Founded in the 19th century by the United States, Liberia formally declared independence in 1847, becoming the first democratic republic on the continent.  From Canada to Japan to Germany, discover which countries around the world celebrate Thanksgiving and what their <b>traditions</b> are. These countries all have their own ways of celebrating Thanksgiving, though some are directly inspired by the classic American <b>traditions</b>.  These <b>African</b> Country Thanksgiving celebrations are often marked by feasts, music, dance, and rituals, offering a unique perspective on giving thanks. Harvest Festivals Across the Continent: A Celebration of Gratitude  With Halloween now over and Thanksgiving on the way, you may be wondering if there&rsquo;s any way to add some African culture to your Thanksgiving celebration. The good news is, there <b>is</b>! A Thanksgiving, or harvest festival, is celebrated in many countries throughout Africa.  The United States isn&rsquo;t the only nation with a holiday dedicated to gratitude&mdash;here are eight different variations of the Thanksgiving <b>tradition</b> from around the world.

This festival dates back to the 16th century, when the Ga people suffered many hardships, including a severe famine, during their travels across <b>Africa</b>. They celebrated their first harvest in Ghana with a feast, and a <b>tradition</b> was born. Homowo literally means &ldquo;hooting at hunger&rdquo;.  Liberia <b>Thanksgiving </b>is an annual observance on the first Thursday of November to thank God for His blessings and mercy, and this year, it falls on November 7. The day has its roots originating from when Liberia used to be a colony of the American Colonization Society.  It is almost Thanksgiving, and while Thanksgiving as we know it in America is not a holiday that is celebrated in most <b>African</b> communities, there are many festivals and <b>traditions</b> that celebrate the abundance of the harvest season. </p>        <p>Happy thanksgiving pumas.
