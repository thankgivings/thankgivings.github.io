        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving new orleans menu Special thanksgiving drinks</strong></h2>
        <p>English <b>explorer</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> hosted the first Canadian Thanksgiving. It was held in what is now Newfoundland during his expedition&#39;s attempts to find the Northwest Passage to the Orient in 1578 and marked their safe arrival to the New World.  The first official, annual Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>, though Indigenous peoples in Canada have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  The first large, national Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>in</b> <b>1859</b> in what was then called the province of Canada. The province of Canada was developed when Upper Canada and Lower Canada were united by Britain in 1841.  Some historians argue that the first Thanksgiving in North America took place in Canada <b>in</b> <b>1578</b>, following Martin Frobisher&rsquo;s safe arrival in Newfoundland after a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage. Even earlier, Indigenous Peoples had their own traditions for honoring the Earth&rsquo;s abundance during the fall season.  It has become common knowledge that the first Thanksgiving in North America was held by <b>Sir</b> Martin Frobisher and his crew in Nunavut in 1578. There are those &mdash; mainly Americans upset by the thought of having their holiday co-opted &mdash; who argue that it wasn&#39;t a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Thanksgiving.  As in the United States, Canada observed occasional Thanksgivings to celebrate important events such as the end of the War of <b>1812</b>. And like its neighbor, Canada&rsquo;s first thanksgivings tended to...  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> after Confederation was observed on 5 April 1872, a national civic holiday rather than a religious one. <b>Thanksgiving</b> was <b>first</b> observed as an annual event <b>in Canada</b> on 6 November 1879. The date for observance and the &lsquo;unifying theme&rsquo; (usually harvest related) was determined annually by our Parliament.  <b>Canada</b> was the <b>first</b> country in North America to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>. In fact, the Indigenous Peoples of <b>Canada</b> have been having annual fall harvest <b>thanksgiving</b> celebrations for hundreds of years prior to the arrival of European settlers. </p>        <p>Shoprite brooklawn nj thanksgiving hours.
