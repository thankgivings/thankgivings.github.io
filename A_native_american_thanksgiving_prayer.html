        <h2><strong>A native american thanksgiving prayer Food for thanksgiving in usa</strong></h2>
        <p>Traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner includes turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes but the First <b>Thanksgiving</b> likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge and venison. Bettmann / Corbis  Delve into the rich history of popcorn as a <b>Thanksgiving</b> treat, from its origins among Native Americans to its modern-day popularity as a holiday snack.  The &quot;Popcorn Myth&quot; would have us believe the Indians introduced the Pilgrims to popcorn at this <b>Thanksgiving</b>: but the Indian corn they grew was Northern Flint, which does not pop well. It was parched to make a simple snack, and the Indians sometimes ground it up and mixed it with strawberries for a cake-like desert.  While this snack&rsquo;s inclusion in the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast is questionable, popcorn is nonetheless an easy alternative to traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> sides. Mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, and stuffing can take anywhere from one to two hours to prepare.  Popcorn fascinated and particularly delighted the young, thus popcorn became increasingly popular around holiday time&mdash;Halloween, <b>Thanksgiving</b>, Easter and especially Christmas. Because of its low cost, popcorn was ideal for Christmas decorations, food, and gift giving.  It&rsquo;s been said that popcorn was part of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast, in Plymouth Colony in 1621. According to myth, Squanto himself taught the Pilgrims to raise and harvest corn, and pop the...  The Mashpee Wampanoag first encountered the Pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower ship in 1620. They say much is missing from the often-told <b>Thanksgiving</b> story.  &ldquo;<b>Franksgiving</b>,&rdquo; as it was known, was decried by Thanksgiving traditionalists and political rivals (one even compared FDR to Hitler) and only adopted by 23 of the 48 states.  As a nation, last year Americans consumed (in one way or another) approximately 12 billion bushels of corn. In celebration of our past heritage and to continue a tradition started in 1621, include corn as a part of your <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner this year. </p>        <p><a href="./509.html">Giant eagle fully cooked thanksgiving dinner</a>.
