        <h2><strong>What grocery stores are open on family day 2024 Thanksgiving words to clients</strong></h2>
        <p>For most Americans, the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Thanksgiving feast includes <b>turkey</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, <b>sweet</b> potato <b>casserole</b>, pumpkin <b>pie</b>, and green <b>bean</b> <b>casserole</b>. The whole meal may last an hour or two.  The Thanksgiving meal is remarkably consistent in its elements: the <b>turkey</b>, the <b>stuffing</b>, the <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b>, the <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>. Barring ethical, health, or religious objections, it is pretty much the same meal for everyone, across latitudes and longitudes, and through the years of their lives.  For most people, enjoying <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, <b>apple</b> pie. But how did the Pilgrims really...  <b>Turkey</b>, <b>corn</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> are all Thanksgiving staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the first Thanksgiving? The answer might surprise you!  <b>What Did</b> the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>Eat</b> on the First Thanksgiving? Many dishes served during modern Thanksgiving meals were not present at the first Thanksgiving. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have potatoes, nor <b>did</b> they have butter or flour necessary for making pies.  What did the pilgrims eat in the first Thanksgiving? **The Pilgrims feasted on a variety of foods during the first Thanksgiving, <b>including</b> <b>venison</b>, <b>wild</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>waterfowl</b>, <b>fish</b>, <b>corn</b>, <b>wheat</b>, <b>barley</b>, <b>peas</b>, <b>beans</b>, <b>onions</b>, <b>radishes</b>, <b>carrots</b>, <b>turnips</b>, <b>pumpkins</b>, and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b>.**  What Did the Pilgrims Eat? Today, we <b>eat</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>stuffing</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>vegetables</b> as the base feast for our Thanksgivings. We also tend to have lots of pies and bread.  Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of the harvest celebration shared by the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony in...  When we think of Thanksgiving meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>did</b> <b>eat</b> turkey in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving dinner west seattle.
