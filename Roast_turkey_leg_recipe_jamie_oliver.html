        <h2><strong>Roast turkey leg recipe jamie oliver Thanksgiving dishes from each state</strong></h2>
        <p>First, planning a <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal for the front end of the day means you&rsquo;ll have more time in the day to enjoy it! If you eat the big meal at night, then you have to worry about finding something to eat for lunch (which might end up spoiling your appetite).  Americans don&rsquo;t agree on what time to eat. Although nearly all Americans agree that <b>Thanksgiving</b> is worth celebrating, there&rsquo;s no consensus on the right time to eat. Pew found that 36% of U.S. adults would prefer to have <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> between 12 and 3 p.m., while 38% want the food to be served between 3 and 6 p.m.  I&rsquo;m all for Thanksgiving dining earlier &ndash; it can <b>be</b> <b>2</b> <b>p</b>.<b>m</b>., 3 p.m. or even 5 p.m. in your home, but should certainly start earlier than your usual 7 or 8 p.m. dinner. Here are a few things...  While she doesn&rsquo;t promote having a large meal at any time, Marie-Pierre St-Onge, associate professor of nutritional medicine at Columbia University and center director for the American Heart Association-funded Go Red for Women Strategically Focused Research Center, acknowledges that <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a day when people tend to overindulge and that there are ways to balance that.  Ultimately, the perfect time for <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> depends on your plans and your guests. If you&rsquo;re hosting children or older relatives, an earlier meal might be more practical. If you have guests traveling from afar, a later <b>dinner</b> could give them time to arrive comfortably. Take into account any activities planned for the day.  According to the experts, there isn&#39;t necessarily a <b>right</b> time to start digging in, but there&#39;s absolutely a wrong time. The consensus is that eating too close to when you&#39;ll go to bed...  The <b>timing</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> depends on individual preferences, family traditions, and logistical factors. Here are some common scenarios that could impact the time you choose for your Thanksgiving feast:  Dining at, <b>say</b>, <b>7</b> <b>p</b>.<b>m</b>., while standard on a regular night, precludes one from experiencing the vital activities that follow a feast: a genuine nap and ample time to digest before reheating...  To get some lived perspective, I turned to the true experts of holiday hosting&mdash;grandmas. I spoke with six experienced grandmothers who have collectively hosted hundreds <b>of Thanksgiving</b> dinners, and they all pointed to the same sweet spot: between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. </p>        <p>Nail art design thanksgiving. <em>Roast turkey leg recipe jamie oliver</em>.
