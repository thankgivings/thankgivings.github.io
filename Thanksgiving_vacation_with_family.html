        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving vacation with family How did thanksgiving day come about</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> dates to the days of the early American colonists and carries a rich, yet controversial, history. Explore the origins of the holiday. Thanksgiving is the annual holiday that takes place throughout the United States on the last Thursday of November.  Thanksgiving is a popular North American holiday that is central to the origin story of the United States. It is traditionally said to have begun with the Plymouth Thanksgiving <b>in</b> <b>1621</b>, but other Thanksgiving celebrations may have taken place earlier.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  Learn the history and <b>origin</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b>, including the symbols related to the holiday and facts about the Presidential Proclamation.  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the first recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion,...  The colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Company, not the Plymouth Colony, decreed a <b>day</b> of <b>thanksgiving</b> for their victory which is often interpreted by modern-<b>day</b> Native Americans as the basis for the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday which many observe as a <b>Day</b> of Mourning and reflection.  The origins of the term are simple enough: &ldquo;<b>thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; is a compound noun made up of the words &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; and &ldquo;giving.&rdquo; But what might be surprising is that the word was first used in the 1530s, more than a hundred years before the Pilgrim&rsquo;s first &ldquo;<b>thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo;  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  <b>Thanksgiving Day</b> is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving mass sacramento.
