        <h2><strong>What to do in detroit thanksgiving weekend Thanksgiving meal in 1621</strong></h2>
        <p>Beginning in 1921, Thanksgiving and Armistice Day (introduced in 1919) were celebrated on the same day &mdash; the first Monday in the week <b>of</b> <b>11</b> <b>November</b>. In order to give more recognition to veterans, 11 November was set solely as Remembrance Day in 1931.  Thanksgiving Day in Canada has been a holiday on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> since 1957. It is a chance for people to give thanks for a good harvest and other fortunes in the past year. Thanksgiving Day in Canada is a time for family and food.  Since 1957, Canadian Thanksgiving has been celebrated on the <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b>. This change was made to separate the celebration of the harvest from the Remembrance Day commemorations of Canadian War veterans held in November.  1. Canadian Thanksgiving <b>is</b> in <b>October</b>&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian Thanksgiving happens a full month and a half before American Thanksgiving, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  Thanksgiving (action de gr&acirc;ce in French) or Thanksgiving day, is an official statutory holiday in all Canadian provinces and territories except Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. Canadians have been celebrating Thanksgiving day as an official statutory holiday <b>since</b> <b>1879</b>.  Unlike <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which always falls on the fourth Thursday of November no matter the date, <b>Canada</b>&#39;s version occurs on the second Monday in October&mdash;which is October 9 in 2023. That&#39;s about six weeks before <b>Thanksgiving</b>, although Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> coincidentally coincides with Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples&#39; Day here in the States.  Today Canadian Thanksgiving is held on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> every year, or at least it has been since Canadian Parliament declared it so on January 31, 1957. Before this, Thanksgiving in Canada had been held sporadically, often coinciding with other major events and anniversaries.  Canadians <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the second Monday in October, while <b>Thanksgiving</b> in the United States is <b>celebrated</b> on the fourth Thursday in November. When <b>is Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b>? In 2025, <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> is Monday, October 13.  What&#39;s the difference between Thanksgiving in America and Thanksgiving in Canada? In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b> but in Canada, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.). </p>        <p>Whats open thanksgiving monday brantford.
