        <h2><strong>When is thanksgiving on the 21st Ia riddleys opwn on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Will there be a holiday or national celebration during your trip to <b>Greece</b>? What are the important dates and how do Greeks celebrate? Find out here.  Although Thanksgiving <b>is</b> not celebrated in Greece, Athens can be a fabulous off-season destination and the perfect Thanksgiving escape for your family this (and every) autumn! Here&rsquo;s why: The weather is mild and pleasant during November in Greece; Traveling during Thanksgiving means fewer crowds at popular tourist sites  For thousands of years, festivals for giving thanks <b>have</b> taken place in many locations around the world. In ancient <b>Greece</b>, it was believed that when the god of the Underworld, Hades, abducted the young maiden Persephone, her mother, Demete r, refused to feed the world, and winter came upon the land.  It&rsquo;s true &ndash; Greeks celebrate various and religious or cultural festivals throughout the year. Some of them, like Greek Easter and Christmas, are tied to Greek religion. Others, like the Carnival, the Greek Independence Day, and the Oxi Day, go hand in hand with tradition, customs and history.  Whereas <b>Thanksgiving</b> may be one of the most iconic holidays in the United States when it comes to festive celebrations, based on traditions of turkey dinners and pumpkin pie and simply being a holiday of thanks, what about <b>Greece</b>? <b>Does</b> this Mediterranean country join in the <b>Thanksgiving</b> festivities? Let&#39;s look into the culture of both [&hellip;]  Today Greeks in America and Canada not only celebrate the modern day &ldquo;Thesmophoria,&rdquo; but also add Greek flavor to the American <b>Thanksgiving </b>tradition. Ask any Greek and they will give you a variation on how to cook the turkey, or, you can get chef Peter Minakis&rsquo; Greek style Turkey, below.  The Thesmophoria was a sort of modern day <b>thanksgiving </b>or harvest festival, a strictly women only three day event, dedicated to Demeter, goddess of agriculture and Persephone, her daughter, who was kidnapped by Hades, the god of the underworld.  According to Greek law every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. In addition, there are nine mandatory, official public holidays: New Year&#39;s Day, 6 January, Clean Monday, 25 March,Orthodox Good Friday, Orthodox Easter Monday, 1 May, Orthodox Whit Monday, 15 August, 28 October, 25 December and 26 December. [1] .  This is because <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a celebration of the blessings of a harvest, and &ldquo;Thesmophoria&rdquo; was the first such celebration, when the Ancient Greeks wished to thank Demeter, also known as Thesmophoros, the Greek Goddess of harvest and agriculture &ndash; Demeter presided over grains and the fertility of the earth. </p>        <p>Restaurants open thanksgiving 2024 dover nh.
