        <p>There are so many things wrong with the <b>happy</b> celebration that takes place in elementary schools and its association to American Indian culture; compromised integrity, stereotyping, and...  With the upcoming holiday, known by many as <b>Thanksgiving</b> but recognized by <b>Native</b> American communities as the National Day of Mourning, Peters and other Indigenous activists and scholars are...  Here are a few recommendations to get you started: 1. TASTE. Try out a new Indigenous recipe to add to your table.
