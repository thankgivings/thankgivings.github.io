        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving yard games Big people thanksgiving gifts</strong></h2>
        <p>How did <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>start</b>? Colonists in New England and Canada regularly observed &ldquo;thanksgivings,&rdquo; days of prayer for such blessings as safe journeys, military victories, or abundant harvests. Americans model their holiday on a 1621 harvest feast shared between the Wampanoag people and the English colonists known as Pilgrims .  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the first recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion, the...  But few know the full story behind its creation as a <b>national</b> <b>holiday</b>. It didn&rsquo;t start with a single official declaration or a neat historical moment. Instead, it took years of effort, and the persistence of one determined woman, to make Thanksgiving the nationwide holiday we celebrate today.  The legend of the American Thanksgiving holiday is said to have been based on a feast of thanksgiving in the early days of the American colonies almost <b>400</b> years ago. The tale as it is told in grade schools is a legend, a mythologized version that downplays some of the bleaker history of how Thanksgiving became an American national holiday.  Thanksgiving Day became an official U.S. holiday in <b>1863</b>, and in 1942 the federal government designated the fourth Thursday in November as Thanksgiving. A traditional Thanksgiving meal consists of turkey, cranberries, bread stuffing, and pumpkin pie, among other dishes.  From the earliest fall feasts to the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> football game to the Macy&#39;s Day parade, here&#39;s the full background on how the U.S. holiday evolved to the tradition it is today.  The story of the First Thanksgiving comes from only two sources <b>initially</b>: <b>Bradford</b> <b>and</b> <b>Winslow</b>&#39;<b>s</b> <b>Mourt</b>&#39;<b>s</b> <b>Relation</b>, which gives a detailed account, and Bradford&#39;s Of Plymouth Plantation, which references the event in more general terms. Bradford writes:  The first Thanksgiving service known to be held by Europeans in North America occurred <b>on</b> <b>May</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1578</b>, in Newfoundland, although earlier Church-type services were probably held by Spaniards in La Florida.  That&#39;s why many Native Americans and others mark <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a solemn day of remembrance instead of celebration. Here&#39;s what really went down after the plates were cleared in Plymouth, Mass. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving yard games.
