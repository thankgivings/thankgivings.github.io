        <h2><strong>Happy thanksgiving from church Priest officiated the thanksgiving mass in borgoa</strong></h2>
        <p>Pumpkin pie, <b>turkey</b>, <b>gravy</b>, sweet potato casserole, cornbread, mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce are just a few dishes to be plated on dinner tables for <b>Thanksgiving</b>. In my household, the main star of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is my mom&rsquo;s famous egg <b>noodles</b> with <b>gravy</b>, topped with <b>turkey</b> and a side of roasted carrots and mashed potatoes. Why egg <b>noodles</b>?  These <b>noodles</b> are my family&#39;s favorite part of the <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal. These thick and tasty <b>noodles</b> take the place of the <b>gravy</b>; they get dumped over everything!  Twist on the classic &ndash; Turkey <b>and</b> <b>noodles</b> is just as delicious as the more common chicken and <b>noodles</b>, with the easy substitution of leftover turkey. This often makes an appearance after Thanksgiving or Christmas when we are using up our leftovers.  This is my grandma&#39;s recipe for her famous <b>noodle</b> <b>gravy</b>! We have it for Thanksgiving <b>and</b> Christmas. Everyone lathers it on their turkey and mashed potatoes and it&#39;s the best part of the holiday dinner!  When the <b>noodles</b> were just right &mdash; soft with no bite &mdash; and the broth a thick, salty <b>gravy</b>, then the meal could begin.  In search of a <b>gravy</b> recipe that would break that cycle, I tested the five most popular <b>gravy</b> recipes on Allrecipes.com in search of one that was delicious and could actually be made in advance. What did I find? Spoiler alert: Prepare for the big day to feel a whole lot easier&mdash;and for your guests to request your recipe. What Makes a Perfect <b>Gravy</b>?  Instead of dumplings, she uses egg <b>noodles</b>, and she creates a thick broth using leftover gravy as the base. It&rsquo;s just the kind of dish we all appreciate from our grandmothers&mdash;simple, hearty, perfect.  Cook the <b>noodles</b> in water in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes, so that they aren&#39;t soggy, but firm. Drain. In a saucepan cook the veggies, minus the tomato. Add some olive oil to coat. Start the heat and when it is really hot add a cup of water, salt and pepper.  The Reynolds family traditionally serves the dish of thickened <b>turkey</b> broth and <b>noodle</b>-shaped dumplings as a side at <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner, next to the roasted bird and mashed potatoes.
