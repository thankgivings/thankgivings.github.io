        <p>Most gracious and merciful God, to whom alone belong the issues of life and death, I <b>Thy</b> <b>unworthy</b> <b>servant</b>, who have been under Thine afflicting hand, and am raised again from the bed of sickness, do here present myself before Thee, in a thankful sense of Thy great mercy and&hellip;  We should render the text, &quot;For a moment in his anger, life in his favour.&quot; (Even here, however, we must beware of always associating <b>sickness</b> with the anger of God.) How gloriously true it is, &quot;He will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger for ever&quot; (Psalm 103:9, 10; Isaiah 57:16-18)! We may not only praise God that our joys vastly ...  <b>Sermon</b> Outline. THANKSGIVING IN THE MIDST OF ADVERSITY. KEY PASSAGE: 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18. SUPPORTING SCRIPTURES: Deuteronomy 31:6 | Matthew 27:46 | Romans 8:28 | Ephesians 5:20 | Philippians 4:6-7 | Hebrews 9:27. SUMMARY. Gratitude comes easily when everything is going our way, but 1 Thessalonians 5:18 says, &ldquo;In everything give thanks.&rdquo;  <b>Giving</b> <b>thanks</b> helps us turn the corner and become grateful people. A <b>thankful</b> spirit is one of the key distinguishing marks of a Christian. In our study we&rsquo;ll look at the benefits of a <b>thankful</b> spirit, and ways we can develop thanksgiving in our lives.  <b>James</b> <b>5:14</b>-<b>15</b>: &quot;<b>Is</b> anyone among you sick? He should call for the elders of the church, and they should pray over him after anointing him with olive oil in the name of the Lord. The prayer of faith will salve the sick person, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.&quot;  In this passage we read today, Jesus is making His way through the territory of Samaria and Judea and meets the 10 lepers. Leprosy in the Bible could include a variety of infectious skin diseases and lepers were considered &ldquo;unclean&rdquo; - polluted or defiled and had to live outside of the cities.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>focuses our attention on God rather than our circumstances. If we fix our eyes on the difficulty, the pain becomes unbearable, peace eludes us, and the situation seems hopeless. But <b>thanksgiving </b>shifts our focus to the Lord and reminds us what we can know for certain: &bull; We&rsquo;re not alone. &bull; God is with us. &bull; He loves us.  Here are thirty-seven <b>sermons</b> appropriate for Thanksgiving. You are welcome to use this material in any way that might be helpful to you as you prepare sermons <b>and</b> Bible studies or simply to increase your own gratitude to the Lord for all his blessings.  THE MAN WHO FORGOT TO BE THANKFUL &ndash; A THANKSGIVING <b>SERMON</b>. A <b>sermon</b> written by Dr. R. L. Hymers, Jr., Pastor Emeritus And preached by Jack Ngann, Pastor at the Baptist Tabernacle of Los Angeles Lord&rsquo;s Day Afternoon, November 24, 2024 &ldquo;Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him&rdquo; (Genesis 40:23; p. 57 Scofield). </p>        <p>Thanksgiving community place rochester ny.
