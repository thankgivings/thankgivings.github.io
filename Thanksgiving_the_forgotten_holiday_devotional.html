        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving the forgotten holiday devotional Best place to buy meals for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>did</b> <b>eat</b> turkey in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  Follow us to the very <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration, where the <b>Pilgrims</b> and the Wampanoag came together for a historic feast.  For most people, <b>enjoying</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>. But how did the Pilgrims...  What Did the Pilgrims Eat on the First Thanksgiving? Many dishes served during modern Thanksgiving meals were not present at the first Thanksgiving. The colonists didn&rsquo;t <b>have</b> <b>potatoes</b>, nor did they have butter or flour necessary for making pies.  It&rsquo;s very, very likely the Pilgrims and <b>Wampanoag</b> ate corn for the first Thanksgiving&mdash;but not the frozen kind that you heat up in the microwave (obviously). Nor was it the boiled kind, the cobbed kind, the pudding kind, or the cornbread kind with little bits of sausage in it that only your great-aunt Suzie knows how to make.  An intriguing aspect of the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621 is the dining etiquette and <b>utensils</b>, or rather the lack thereof, particularly when it comes to forks. The <b>Pilgrims</b>, aligning with the customs of the early 17th century, <b>did</b> not use forks at their feast.  So what foods were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to food historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  Four hundred years later, the so-called <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> is undergoing a reassessment. Museums and historic sites in Plymouth and around the country are telling a more nuanced story about the...  The <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag shared a harvest feast, but it didn&#39;t happen the way you were likely taught in school. Every November, Americans gather around the table to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> in ... </p>        <p>Bozeman thanksgiving dinner 2024. Thanksgiving bingo cards.
