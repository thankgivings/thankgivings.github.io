        <h2><strong>First college football teams to play on thanksgiving day Matthew 22 27 coloring sheets thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>&ldquo;<b>Give</b> <b>thanks</b> in all circumstances, for this is <b>God</b>&#39;<b>s</b> will for you in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; There are three statements in these verses to which I call your attention. We are to give <b>thanks</b> &ldquo;always&rdquo; for &ldquo;everything&rdquo; and &ldquo;in all circumstances.&rdquo; Those statements are easy to verbalize but difficult to realize; easy to preach, difficult to practice.  We thank and praise you, Eternal <b>God</b>, for all your goodness to us. Give thanks to the Lord, who is good. O God, our Provider, you open your hand and lavish good gifts upon us. So we give you thanks. You create the beauty of the earth and stock it with abundance to sustain human life.  Our <b>thanks</b> and praise <b>to God</b> pleases Him. When we humble ourselves before the Almighty, we are brought to our place. King David, even with his power and influence, considered himself a servant of the Lord. He was overwhelmed by the majesty of <b>God</b> almighty; he wrote songs <b>to God</b>. He danced before Him, and yes, shamelessly.  Give <b>thanks</b> for <b>God</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> promises: eternal life (Jn. 3:16), forgive- ness of sins (Matt. 26:28), peace (Jn. 14:27), refuge (Ps. 5:11), rest (Matt. 11:28), strength (2 Sam. 22:33), courage (Matt. 14:27), comfort (Ps. 23), and enduring love (1 Chron. 16:34).  Let us join our hearts and minds in prayer. Almighty <b>God</b>, we give thanks for your gentle and enduring love, for sending us your son Jesus to show us the way to live; for life itself, ....for our lives.... and for this world.  C. &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; is a Mark of Obedience <b>to God</b> &ndash; 1 Thessalonians 5:18 1. <b>God</b>&rsquo;s Word Commands us to be Thankful unto Him. 2. Giving <b>Thanks</b> unto <b>God</b> causes us to: a. Focus on What <b>God</b> has Done b. Depend on What <b>God</b> is Doing c. Rejoice on What will Do NOTE: A Thankless Christian is a DEFEATED AND DISOBEDIENT CHRISTIAN but  <b>2</b> Corinthians <b>9:15</b> - &ldquo;Thanks be unto <b>God</b> for His unspeakable gift.&rdquo; The Christian life has been called &ldquo;a life of continual <b>thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; ~ not simply thanksgiving at certain times but &ldquo;continual&rdquo; ~ &ldquo;giving thanks always&rdquo; (Eph. 5:20).  Know this: The Lord is <b>God</b>; he himself has made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. Enter <b>God</b>&rsquo;s gates with <b>thanksgiving</b>; Go into his courts with praise; Give <b>thanks</b> to him, and call upon his Name. For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his faithfulness endures from age to age.  We give you <b>thanks</b>, most gracious God, for the beauty of earth and sky and sea; for the richness of mountains, plains, and rivers; for the songs of birds and the loveliness of flowers. We praise you for these good gifts, and pray that we may safeguard them for our posterity. Grant that we </p>        <p>2024 thanksgiving surf cup. Aps winter break 2024. Thanksgiving and mayflower.
