        <h2><strong>What day was thanksgiving day on in 1951 Humorous thanksgiving devotional</strong></h2>
        <p>These free Walt <b>Disney</b> World <b>crowd</b> calendars rate dates so you can choose best weeks to go &amp; avoid the worst, skipping long lines and high wait times. We cover seasonal events, weather, park hours, Orlando travel trends, and factors impacting when to visit Florida&rsquo;s theme parks. (Updated October 1, 2024.)  Early November kicks off with strong <b>crowds</b>, mid-November offers a bit of a breather (minus Veterans Day weekend), and Thanksgiving week brings a full holiday rush. Here&rsquo;s what you can expect at each stage of the month and some strategies to make the most of your visit.  We&#39;re going 11/30 (Tuesday) - 12/8 (<b>Wednesday</b>) which has typically been one of the better times to visit given it&#39;s immediately after the Thanksgiving crowd leaves. Saturday during that trip will be our down day, visit Disney Springs, Pool Day, etc.  Want to see the <b>crowds</b> for the next 30 days? Get access to the full 365 <b>Crowd</b> Calendar, Lines app, 140+ Touring Plans and much more. Our <b>Crowd</b> Calendar will help you answer &#39;<b>When</b> to go to Walt <b>Disney</b> World?&#39; This calendar ranks <b>crowds</b> for the next 365 days to help you have the best trip possible.  In the <b>Disney</b> World <b>crowd</b> calendar below you&#39;ll see the <b>crowd</b> ratings for all four theme parks, notable dates that may impact <b>crowds</b>, and the calendar dates for Walt Disney World events. Click on the specific event or crowd rating below for more information.  Offering a bit more insight here, Thanksgiving week crowds tend to be worst the Sunday through <b>Tuesday</b> before Thanksgiving before a comparative lull on late Wednesday and early Thursday. (Those time frames are still bad, just not the threat level midnight crowds of the prior 3 days.)  November <b>15</b>-<b>16</b> &ndash; heavy weekend crowds as guests arriving for their vacation and those leaving Walt Disney World overlap; November 17-21 &ndash; moderate crowds before Thanksgiving guests arrive; November 22-23 &ndash; heavy crowds arrive for the Thanksgiving holiday; November 24-30 &ndash; peak Thanksgiving crowds  Our <b>Disney</b> World <b>Crowd</b> Calendar predicts the <b>crowds</b> at Walt <b>Disney</b> World for every day in the next 12 months. Our estimates are broken down by <b>Disney</b> World theme park: Animal Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios, and Magic Kingdom.  It&rsquo;s the week <b>after</b> a very busy <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>weekend</b>, so let&rsquo;s check in on how busy the <b>Disney</b> World parks are! Bright, sunny Cinderella Castle! The holidays are a super popular time for people to visit <b>Disney</b> World, but it&rsquo;s still early December, and we never know when the parks are gonna have unexpectedly busy days! </p>        <p>Retail stores open christmas day.
