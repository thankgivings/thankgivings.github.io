        <p>Is Disneyland good to visit on Thanksgiving? Disneyland is <b>good</b> to visit on Thanksgiving! Many restaurants will have special Thanksgiving Day only menus and the holiday decorations in the park are the perfect ambiance to start thinking about Christmas.  Wondering which days of the <b>week</b> to <b>visit</b> <b>Disneyland</b> and Disney California Adventure for the lowest crowds? This guide covers which dates have the lowest and highest wait times, plus commentary about weekdays vs. weekends, Halloween &amp; Christmas seasons, how SoCal ticket deals impact daily attendance, and more.  Disneyland is typically most crowded around holidays, weekends, or really just about any time schools are out of session. Here are some of the time periods to avoid, if possible: Any school holiday <b>weeks</b> (February Vacation, Spring Break, Thanksgiving, Christmas/New Year&rsquo;s).  Use this guide to <b>Disneyland</b> at <b>Thanksgiving</b> to help you manage crowds and make the most of this holiday. Disneyland Thanksgiving falls during Holidays at the Disneyland Resort. This is always one of our favorite times to visit.  You can expect crowd levels to fall from 8/10 to 10/10 levels the <b>week</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> to 2/10 to 5/10 levels that next <b>week</b>. However, this is not necessarily the best <b>week</b> to <b>visit</b> during the holiday season (and by extension, the entire year). Our favorite <b>week</b> usually occurs one <b>week</b> later, and will start instead on Sunday, December 8, 2024.  The week of Thanksgiving: The Thanksgiving holiday week is another incredibly popular time to visit Disneyland and will see huge crowds! <b>December</b> <b>22nd</b> - December <b>31st</b> : The few days before Christmas and following weeks into January is one of the busiest stretches of the year to visit Disneyland.  Overall, spending <b>Thanksgiving</b> at <b>Disneyland</b> can be a wonderful experience filled with holiday magic. Just keep an eye on crowd levels and consider using Genie+ or Lightning Lane to make the most of your <b>visit</b>! Restaurants throughout <b>Disneyland</b> Park will serve slow-roasted Turkey on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day.  While <b>Disneyland</b> is busy in November, there are some days that might be better than others! Hint: <b>Disneyland</b> isn&rsquo;t too busy on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day! Who knew? Here are the holiday season tips you need. <b>Disneyland</b> In November: The Best Month? We say it is one of the best months- so, YES!  If you&#39;d like to visit for Holiday Time, we recommend <b>mid</b>-<b>November</b> (<b>not</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>week</b>) and <b>early</b> December as the best time to visit Disneyland. Watch out for the weekend of Dec. 7-8, 2024, when the Candlelight Processional disrupts the park schedule and draws big crowds. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving collage poems.
