        <h2><strong>Pottery barn taper candles for thanksgiving Thanksgiving coloring heets</strong></h2>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what the Pilgrims ate at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  &quot;<b>Sobaheg</b>&quot; means stew in the Wampanoag language, and there&#39;s a good chance it was served as part of the first Thanksgiving meal. A traditional autumn sobaheg contains a mixture of cooked beans, corn, squash, and nuts, all seasoned with salt.  Traditional Thanksgiving dinner includes <b>turkey</b>, stuffing and mashed potatoes but the First Thanksgiving likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge and venison. Bettmann / Corbis  The first Thanksgiving banquet consisted of foods <b>like</b> <b>venison</b>, <b>bean</b> <b>stew</b> <b>and</b> <b>hard</b> <b>biscuits</b>. And while corn and pumpkin had their place on the table, they hardly resembled the cornbread stuffing and pumpkin pie we feast on today.  So what foods were <b>served</b> at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden <b>meal</b> but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  The meal consisted of <b>deer</b>, <b>corn</b>, <b>shellfish</b>, and <b>roasted</b> <b>meat</b>, different from today&#39;s traditional Thanksgiving feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks...  There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest <b>meal</b>. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn bread and porridge.  Neither Bradford or Winslow&rsquo;s writing reveal what was actually served at the first Thanksgiving meal, besides fowl and deer, but guesses can be made based on the types of food they often wrote about such <b>as</b> <b>mussels</b>, <b>lobsters</b>, <b>grapes</b>, <b>plums</b>, <b>corn</b> <b>and</b> <b>herbs</b>.  From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years. </p>        <p>Results of thanksgiving nfl games.
