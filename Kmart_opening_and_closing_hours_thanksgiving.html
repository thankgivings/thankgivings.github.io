        <h2><strong>Kmart opening and closing hours thanksgiving Thanksgiving brunch at the chase park plaza</strong></h2>
        <p>The legend of the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday is said to have been based on a feast <b>of thanksgiving</b> in the early days of the American colonies almost 400 years ago. The tale as it is told in grade schools is a legend, a mythologized version that downplays some of the bleaker history of how <b>Thanksgiving</b> became an American national holiday.  In the English <b>tradition</b>, days <b>of thanksgiving</b> and special <b>thanksgiving</b> religious services became important during the English Reformation in the reign of Henry VIII. [3] Before 1536 there were 95 Church holidays, plus 52 Sundays, when people were required to attend church and forego work.  Festivals <b>of Thanksgiving</b> were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years. They tended to be autumn harvest celebrations. But in 1789, Elias Boudinot, Massachusetts, member of the House of Representatives, moved that a day <b>of Thanksgiving</b> be held to thank God for giving the American people the opportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their hard won freedoms.  Plymouth Colony &amp; First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  In the 16th and 17th centuries, <b>Thanksgiving</b> days were called following significant events such as drought and floods, as well as the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. 7. Turkey at <b>Thanksgiving</b> came much later. Though <b>Thanksgiving</b> is commonly associated with eating turkey, no turkey was eaten at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration in Plymouth.  The Origins <b>of Thanksgiving</b> . <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>traditions</b> can be traced back to harvest festivals, when the Pilgrims from England and the Native Americans they encountered gave thanks for a bountiful ...  Featured. <b>Thanksgiving</b> 2024. <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, observed in 2024 on Thursday, November 28, honors a 1621 feast between the Plymouth colonists from England and the Wampanoag people.  The very first <b>Thanksgiving</b> football game was played between Princeton and Yale in 1876. American football was in its infancy, but the sport and the <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>tradition</b> quickly caught on. By ... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving & uncle bob.
