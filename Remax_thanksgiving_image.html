        <h2><strong>Remax thanksgiving image Thanksgiving turkey trouble guided reading level</strong></h2>
        <p>When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the Pilgrims did eat turkey in <b>1621</b>, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  In a review of Robert Tracy McKenzie&rsquo;s The First <b>Thanksgiving</b>: What the Real Story Tells Us About Loving God and Learning from History (IVP, 2013), John Turner summarized what we know about that original feast in 1621:  What was really on the <b>menu</b> at the famous first banquet in <b>1621</b>? And which of today&rsquo;s favorites didn&rsquo;t earn a place at the table until later? Learn about the history of the first Thanksgiving...  See what was really on the <b>menu</b>! For most Americans, the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Thanksgiving feast includes turkey, cranberry sauce, sweet potato casserole, pumpkin pie, and green bean casserole. The whole meal may last an hour or two.  For most people, enjoying turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin for <b>Thanksgiving</b> is as traditional and American as, well, apple pie. But how did the Pilgrims really celebrate on...  Have you ever wondered what the Pilgrims ate at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  These two sources contain all we know firsthand about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> food. The rest of the <b>menu</b> we can only piece together, based upon what was available, what both groups ate in times of celebration, and what the Native Americans would have (literally) brought to the table.  From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The <b>menu</b> offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the <b>1620s</b> and how the celebration has changed over the years.  All the things the first Pilgrims and the native Wampanoag ate back in the year <b>1621</b>, right? Of course, we know that isn&rsquo;t exactly accurate. For one thing, macaroni and cheese is definitely not a traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> food, nor did the Pilgrims and Wampanoag have oven-safe dishes for baking green-bean casseroles. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving seafood side dishes.
