        <h2><strong>Best and worst thanksgiving foods Home depot hours for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>The cornucopia is a ubiquitous symbol of <b>abundance</b>, especially around Thanksgiving, starring in centerpieces on bountiful tables across the land. But where did the &ldquo;horn of plenty&rdquo; originate? A Thanksgiving cornucopia has a much longer, more elaborate history than you may imagine.  The cornucopia is typically a <b>hollow</b>, <b>horn</b>-<b>shaped</b> <b>wicker</b> <b>basket</b> filled with various seasonal fruits and vegetables. Though most Americans associate the cornucopia with the Thanksgiving holiday, it was around long before Columbus sailed to America.  Every Thanksgiving, the <b>horn</b>-<b>shaped</b> <b>cornucopia</b>, a curving basket overflowing with fruit, nuts, and vegetables, appears on tables as part of the holiday decor. But where did this unique-looking symbol originate? And why do we see it everywhere during harvest season?  The cornerstone of Thanksgiving decor is the <b>not</b>-<b>so</b>-<b>humble</b> cornucopia: a <b>horn</b> whose broad opening overflows with the fruits of a bountiful harvest.  The <b>cornucopia</b> has long been a symbol of the Thanksgiving season &mdash; a large (often wicker) horn overflowing with fruits and vegetables and grains. It&rsquo;s also known as the horn of plenty, and for good reason. The word <b>cornucopia</b> comes from the Latin cornu &ldquo;horn&rdquo; (also the source of unicorn) and copiae &ldquo;abundance.&rdquo;  Dive into <b>cornucopia</b> meaning, history, and origins as we celebrate the Thanksgiving season with overflowing tables and wishes of gratitude.  While we can all agree that food and family are the most important elements of Thanksgiving, the <b>cornucopia</b> is a symbol that has come to represent the holiday while also giving the table a finished and festive look when used as DIY Thanksgiving centerpieces.  You probably made plenty of <b>cornucopia</b> crafts as a kid and know it has something to do with Thanksgiving, but what exactly is it? Here we give you a rundown of everything you need to know about the Thanksgiving <b>cornucopia</b> (pronounced kor&middot;nuh&middot;kow&middot;pee&middot;uh), its origins, and it symbolism.  The <b>cornucopia</b>, literally &#39;horn of plenty,&#39; comes to the Thanksgiving table thanks to Greek mythology. The horn may have originally been that of a goat which the infant Zeus used to drink from. In the story of Zeus&#39; childhood, it is told that he was sent away to a cave for safekeeping to prevent his father Cronus from eating him. </p>        <p>Samantha bee politics thanksgiving dinner family.
