        <h2><strong>Words you can make out of thanksgiving Ideas for thanksgiving contest</strong></h2>
        <p>If the Divine <b>Liturgy</b> was that of Saint John Chrysostom the following Troparia: Grace shone forth from your mouth like fire, illuminating the inhabited world. You treasured for the world the virtue of being unmercenary, and revealed your sublime humility.  The songs and prayers following Holy Communion in the Divine <b>Liturgy</b>, as all parts of the holy service, presuppose that the members of the Church are partaking in the eucharistic mysteries and are receiving the gifts of Christ&rsquo;s Body and Blood.  O Existing One, Master Lord, God, almighty and adorable Father: It is truly meet and right and befitting the majesty of Thy holiness that we should praise Thee, hymn Thee, bless Thee, worship Thee, give thanks unto Thee and glorify Thee, the only truly existing God, and offer unto Thee with contrite heart and spirit of humility this our rational...  <b>Orthodox</b> Prayer of Thanksgiving O Lord my Savior and my Master, I, Thine unprofitable servant, with fear and trembling give thanks unto Thy loving goodness for all Thy benefits which Thou hast poured so abundantly upon me, Thy servant.  Prayer of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, 1. I thank Thee, O Lord my God, that Thou hast not rejected me, a sinner, but hast vouchsafed me to be a communicant of Thy Holy Things. I thank Thee that Thou hast vouchsafed me, the unworthy, to partake of Thy most pure and heavenly Gifts.  <b>O</b> <b>Lord</b>, make us free! He fed them with the finest wheat * and satisfied them with honey from the rock. Sing to the Lord with all your heart always and for everything, * giving thanks in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God the Father. Psalm. Sing with joy to God our strength; * and raise a loud shout to the God of Jacob. Gloria.  At this point the Deacon proclaims the following <b>Litany</b>: Let us rise. Having partaken of the divine, holy, pure, and immortal, heavenly, life-giving, and awesome Mysteries of Christ, worthily let us give thanks unto the Lord. Help us, save us; have mercy upon us; and keep us, O God, by Thy Grace.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is an essential expression of our worship and prayer as <b>Orthodox </b>Christians. When we gather in our parishes and when we direct our minds and hearts toward God seeking His guidance, we offer our deepest gratitude to Him for His love and the gift of salvation.  Its radiant spirit of transcendent gratefulness quietly sustained <b>Orthodox</b> Christians suffering under that violent persecution of the Church. The manuscript of the akathist comes to us from Archpriest Grigoriy Petrov, imprisoned in a Soviet labor camp. </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/792.html">Thanksgiving dinner images funny</a>. <a href="./642.html">Funny jokes for thanksgiving day</a>.
