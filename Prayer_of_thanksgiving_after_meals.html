        <h2><strong>Prayer of thanksgiving after meals Macy thanksgiving parade first</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> is approaching and no one has anything to do except Diane, who is among a select few graduate students one of her professors has asked to spend <b>Thanksgiving</b> with his family, celebrating in the pilgrim&#39;s tradition.  On <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day 1986, <b>Cheers</b> aired &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b> Orphans,&rdquo; an <b>episode</b> that garnered emphatic praise - and angry letters. By this point, <b>Cheers</b> was one of the most-watched shows on...  Both <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>episodes</b> are available on Hulu, Netflix, <b>YouTube</b>. Though the show is syndicated less fervently than it used to be&mdash;at least by my cable provider, who slots it into insomniac hours on the Hallmark channel&mdash;it&#39;s still on television.  Classic <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>episode</b> of &quot;<b>Cheers</b>&quot;  When <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner is delayed, tensions run high and the <b>Cheers</b> gang gets hangry, leading to an epic food fight that leaves no one spared. From the ful...  Clips of seasonal <b>episodes</b> of <b>Cheers</b>.<b>Featuring</b> Sam Malone, Diane Chambers, Woody Boyd, Carla Tortelli, Cliff Clavin, Norm Peterson, Frasier Crane, Lilith Ste...  Diane suggests that the rest of the gang spend <b>Thanksgiving</b> together in Carla&#39;s new home. Carla agrees to a potluck dinner, with Norm in charge of the humongous turkey. Woody, Cliff and Frasier are solo for the day, but Sam is to bring his date Wendy and Norm is to bring his never seen wife Vera.  S5 E9: The gang gathers at Carla&#39;s house for a <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner of frozen turkey and overdone peas. Which Character from <b>Cheers</b> Are You? Wander in... pull up a stool... and make yourself at home &quot;where everybody knows your name.&quot;  <b>Cheers</b> -- &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b> Orphans&rdquo; (S5, E9) In a show full of rowdy drinking, yelling and some jokes that didn&rsquo;t age too well, this <b>Cheers</b> <b>episode</b> is really quite beautiful. </p>        <p>Best long lasting lipstick thanksgiving.
