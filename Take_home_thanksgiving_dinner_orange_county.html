        <p>Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> in <b>October</b>, while Thanksgiving in the United States is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November. When is Thanksgiving in Canada? In 2025, Thanksgiving in Canada is Monday, October 13.  Thanksgiving Day in Canada has been a holiday on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> since 1957. It is a chance for people to give thanks for a good harvest and other fortunes in the past year. Thanksgiving Day in Canada is a time for family and food.  Since 1957, <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day has been a holiday in <b>Canada</b> on the second Monday of October. Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a chance for people to give thanks for fortunes in the past year, including a good harvest. Below, we will explain what people <b>do</b> on Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b>, as well as the ways that it differs from U.S. <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  Thanksgiving in Canada always falls on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> in <b>October</b> &mdash; well before Americans are even thinking of buying their turkey! It&rsquo;s been this way since 1957, when the government finally settled on an official date.  What&#39;s the difference between Thanksgiving in America and Thanksgiving in Canada? In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b> but in Canada, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.).  Unlike <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which always falls on the fourth Thursday of November no matter the date, <b>Canada</b>&#39;s version occurs on the second Monday in October&mdash;which is October 9 in 2023. That&#39;s about six weeks before <b>Thanksgiving</b>, although Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> coincidentally coincides with Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples&#39; Day here in the States.  Canadian Thanksgiving is in <b>October</b>&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian Thanksgiving happens a full month and a half before American Thanksgiving, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  The first official, annual Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>, though Indigenous peoples in Canada have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  Thanksgiving in Canada is celebrated on <b>the</b> second Monday <b>of</b> <b>October</b> every year. This corresponds to October 14, 2024. Canadian Thanksgiving has a rich history and story behind it that is not rooted in the American celebration. Thanksgiving is an official holiday in Canada. </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/424.html">Grocery stores open on thanksgiving north york</a>. Scholastic scope thanksgiving.
