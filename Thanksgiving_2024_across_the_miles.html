        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving 2024 across the miles El camino college compton event thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>We lift them up to the Lord. Let us give <b>thanks</b> to the Lord our <b>God</b>. It is right to give our <b>thanks</b> and praise. Father Almighty (almighty <b>God</b>), creator of heaven and earth. By your appointment the seasons come and go. You bring forth bread from the earth and create the fruit of the vine.  Every morning when we open our eyes, we should give <b>thanks</b> to <b>God</b> for the gift of life. Every time someone speaks our name, we should thank <b>God</b> for the gift of family and friends. Every time a bird sings or a dog barks we should thank <b>God</b> for the beauty and diversity of his creation.  Remember the story of the <b>Good</b> <b>Samaritan</b>, everyone is your neighbor, no exceptions. As you give thanks this week for your many blessings, ask God to give you wisdom, direction, opportunities, and the courage to combine all of those into the action(s) of serving others.  Let us give thanks to the Lord our <b>God</b>. It is right to give our thanks and praise. It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty (almighty God), creator of heaven and earth. You formed us in your image and breathed into us the breath of life.  <b>Merciful</b> <b>God</b>, we get so caught up in our own lives and needs that we fail to see others for whom we might provide some help and relief. You challenge us to feed those who are hungry and to quench the thirst of those who are parched.  <b>Yours</b>, <b>Lord</b>, is the <b>kingdom</b>; you are exalted as head over all. Wealth and honor come from you; you are the ruler of all things. In your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all. Now, our God, we give you thanks, and praise your glorious name. Amen.  Summary: A <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>sermon</b>. PSALM 100:1-5. &ldquo;The Basis of Our Thanksgiving&rdquo; By: Rev. Kenneth Sauer, Pastor of Parkview United Methodist Church, Newport News, VA. The 100th Psalm was written for the people of Israel.  The <b>kingdom</b> of <b>God</b> is a way of describing the reign of God. United Methodists, with other Christians, recognize that the reign of God is both a present and future reality. John Wesley recognized both of these aspects of God&#39;s reign: &quot;The kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God are but two phrases for the same thing.  Later on this week, our country will celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day which is a time to give thanks for our many blessings. The psalmist encouraged people everywhere to direct their thanks to <b>God</b>, for he is worthy. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving 2024 day of week. Thanksgiving celebrations through the ages.
