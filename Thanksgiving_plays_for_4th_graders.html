        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving plays for 4th graders Restaurants open thanksgiving mn</strong></h2>
        <p>So, they had a great deal to be thankful for at their 1621 harvest feast, even if the term &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; was not used that first year. Although their exact <b>menu</b> has been lost to us, Wampanoag oral history, plus a few Costco receipts left by Pilgrims, suggest that corn, beans, and squash were central to that feast.  The traditional meal <b>includes</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b> with <b>marshmallows</b>, <b>glazed</b> <b>carrots</b>, <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> <b>casserole</b>, <b>macaroni</b> and <b>cheese</b>, <b>rolls</b>&mdash;<b>you</b> name it. All the things the first Pilgrims and the native Wampanoag ate back in the year 1621, right?  This original <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>menu</b> comes from Plimouth Plantation, a historical village dedicated to telling the true history of America&#39;s earliest settlers.  What Was on the Menu at the First Thanksgiving? Traditional Thanksgiving dinner <b>includes</b> <b>turkey</b>, stuffing and mashed potatoes but the First Thanksgiving likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge...  More likely, the first Thanksgiving menu probably <b>included</b> <b>ducks</b>, <b>geese</b>, and <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeons</b>. Instead of stuffing them with bread, as many people do with their Thanksgiving turkeys today, the colonists may have stuffed the birds with herbs and onion pieces to give them flavor.  These two sources contain all we know firsthand about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> food. The rest of the menu we can only piece together, based upon what was available, what both groups ate in times of celebration, and what the Native Americans would have (literally) brought to the table.  See what was really on the <b>menu</b>! For most Americans, the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Thanksgiving feast <b>includes</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> <b>casserole</b>, <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b>, and <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> <b>casserole</b>. The whole meal may last an hour or two.  The first and most important staple of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is the turkey, but it wasn&#39;t the only meat on the Puritans&#39; table. The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>menu</b> in 1621 looked pretty different from our...  Have you ever wondered what the Pilgrims ate at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving <b>meal</b>. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving activities louisville ky. Which mall is open on thanksgiving day in toronto.
