        <h2><strong>Friends thanksgiving episode season 8 Happy thanksgiving god bless your family</strong></h2>
        <p>Tomorrow <b>is </b>La Festa del Ringraziamento! Of course, this <b>is </b>only <b>celebrated in </b>the USA, but many cultures have been celebrating harvests for centuries. Did you know that the Romans also <b>celebrated </b>a large annual harvest? This festival was called Cerelia, which honored Ceres, the goddess of agriculture, grain, and fertility.  Thanksgiving is a distinctly American and Canadian holiday, and while it&#39;s not celebrated in Rome, you may want to sit down to an authentic Thanksgiving feast if you happen to be in Rome on this holiday. Canadian Thanksgiving is celebrated on the <b>2nd</b> <b>Monday</b> in <b>October</b>, while American Thanksgiving is celebrated on the 4th Thursday in November.  The traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> basics of Roasted Turkey and pumpkin pie are found on most tables that <b>day</b>. While Italians do not typically <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> as Americans do, there are many religious holidays throughout the year.  La Festa del Ringraziamento &ndash; or Italian <b>Thanksgiving </b>&ndash; <b>is </b>a <b>day </b>to give thanks for the harvest and express gratitude for the blessings of life. <b>In </b>this blog, we&rsquo;ll dive into the history, food traditions, and patron saint celebrations of Italian <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  Known in Italy as il Giorno del ringraziamento, Thanksgiving in 2024 falls on <b>Thursday</b> <b>28</b> <b>November</b>. For Americans in Italy craving a taste of home, here is a quick guide to the main Thanksgiving events taking place as well as some tips on where to stock up on ingredients for the perfect Thanksgiving meal at home.  Thanksgiving is always celebrated on <b>the</b> <b>4</b> <b>th</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> the <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. Now that you know about Italian Thanksgiving traditions, it&rsquo;s time to celebrate the holiday! Buona festa del ringraziamento!  Why doesn&rsquo;t <b>Italy</b> <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? The answer lies in history, culture and tradition. This article explores the reasons for the absence of Thanksgiving in Italy <b>and</b> how Italians deal with gratitude and celebration in their own unique way.  Italian Thanksgiving, for most Italian Americans, then, means the inclusion of special Italian recipes to accompany the roast turkey, stuffing, pumpkin pie, Macy&#39;s Annual Thanksgiving Day Parade, and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>.  This is all to say that cultures celebrate the end of the harvest with a shared feast of the bounty, which is exactly what Thanksgiving is. So, let&rsquo;s see how is <b>thanksgiving</b> in Rome! However, celebrating a traditional holiday outside your native country can be challenging. </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/856.html">Thanksgiving bookshelf speaker</a>.
