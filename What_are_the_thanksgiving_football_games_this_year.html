        <p>Thanksgiving Day at Walt Disney World is going to be <b>super</b> <b>crowded</b>. This will make you so frustrated on your solo Disney trip and if you go with a group, you guys may become snappy with each other.  Leading up to <b>Thanksgiving</b>, we saw increased <b>crowds</b> and wait times. But just how many people opt for Disney <b>World</b> over <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner at grandma&rsquo;s house? Let&rsquo;s check it out. We visited Magic Kingdom this morning to check on the <b>crowds</b> and wait times, and we were surprised! Here is a look at the entrance on <b>Thanksgiving</b> morning.  You might be wondering what our big plans are for the day. Well, we&rsquo;re at Disney <b>World</b> because we just can&rsquo;t get enough of those holiday decorations, holiday snacks, and that everyday Disney magic! But what are <b>crowds</b> like on <b>Thanksgiving</b>?  Here&rsquo;s a look into the holiday <b>crowds</b> at Disney <b>World</b> this weekend! Disney&rsquo;<b>s</b> Hollywood Studios has a lot to offer this week, from a newly reopened Woody&rsquo;s Lunchbox to new merchandise, and as always, the highly popular Rise of the Resistance attraction in Star Wars: Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge.  Thanksgiving at Disney World brings in <b>extra</b> <b>crowds</b>, which means restaurant queues will also be extra long. You&#39;ll save time waiting in line for food if you eat during off-peak times. Eat an early breakfast and have an early lunch at 11 a.m. Alternatively, eat a big breakfast and have a late lunch.  If you&rsquo;re visiting Walt Disney <b>World</b> for <b>Thanksgiving</b> 2024 and are looking for last-minute restaurant ideas, avoiding holiday <b>crowds</b>, etc., we&rsquo;ve got you covered. Here we answer frequently asked questions, info, and tips for avoiding Thanksgiving week <b>crowds</b>.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is notoriously a busy travel day for people across the country. So, how do the <b>crowds</b> compare in Disney <b>World</b>? Come with us to Magic Kingdom to find out! We arrived at Magic Kingdom bright and early on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day. When we got to the park <b>around</b> 7:30AM, things were pretty quiet, but the park didn&rsquo;t officially open until 8AM.  In the Disney <b>World</b> <b>crowd</b> calendar below you&#39;ll see the <b>crowd</b> ratings for all four theme parks, notable dates that may impact <b>crowds</b>, and the calendar dates for Walt Disney <b>World</b> events. Click on the specific event or crowd rating below for more information.  With mild temps, holiday decor, and not-as-busy-as-other-holidays crowds, spending <b>Thanksgiving</b> at Disney <b>World</b> is a great idea for many people.
