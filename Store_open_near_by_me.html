        <h2><strong>Store open near by me Thanksgiving hats for kindergarteners</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Vera</b> Peterson (n&eacute;e Kreitzer) (Bernadette Birkett) is the wife of Norm Peterson (George Wendt) Most of <b>Vera</b>&#39;s appearances are uncredited voice-overs, although her body is seen in the fifth-season episode &quot;<b>Thanksgiving</b> Orphans&quot;; her face is covered by filling from a pie Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) throws at Sam. In the ninth season episode &quot;It ...  The final arrival at the party is Norm&rsquo;s never-seen wife, <b>Vera</b> &mdash; who winds up getting smacked in the kisser with a pie just before we catch sight of her face. &ldquo;Throwing food is the most fun that you can possibly have,&rdquo; Perlman said of Carla&rsquo;s chuck-and-duck feast.  Cheers began back in 1982 and ran for 11 seasons and 275 episodes. One of my favorite episodes of the sitcom (and quite possibly of any sitcom) is the one that aired on <b>Thanksgiving</b> evening (November 27th) in 1986 titled &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b> Orphans&rdquo;. It was season 5, episode 9 and, yes, it did actually and appropriately air on <b>Thanksgiving</b> night.  <b>Vera</b> Peterson (nee Kreitzer) is Norm&#39;s wife, who is an unseen character mentioned often in the series. It is revealed in the pilot episode, Give Me a Ring Sometime, that she knows that Norm hangs out at Cheers but doesn&#39;t care. Despite Norm&#39;s constant jokes about <b>Vera</b>, he is shown at times to actually deeply care for her, such as when she was fired by John Allen Hill. Even though <b>Vera</b> is never ...  <b>Cheers </b>is streaming now on Peacock https://peacocktv.com/watch-online/tv/<b>cheers</b>/5238315416859544112?cid=20200715librarytitleownyt449&amp;utm_campaign=20200715lib...  Lampshaded by Sam on her no longer being The Ghost when he Stage Whispers to the others, &quot;We&#39;re finally going to meet <b>Vera</b>!&quot; Family of Choice: Discussed Trope, as Frasier says &quot;Family is not limited to blood relations.&quot; And of course the <b>Thanksgiving</b> gathering shows how the Cheers gang really is a family.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Orphans is the 9th episode of Season 5 of Cheers. This episode was written by Cheri Eichen &amp; Bill Steinkellner, and directed by James Burrows. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on November 27, 1986. In the cold open, Woody breaks out the Christmas decorations as Frasier teaches about the horribly-distorted version of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. With ahead of the ...  &quot;<b>Thanksgiving</b> Orphans&quot; is the ninth episode of the fifth season of the American television sitcom Cheers, co-written by Cheri Eichen and Bill Steinkeller and directed by James Burrows. It aired originally on November 27, 1986, on NBC. The characters do not have families or friends to spend time with, and some of their plans backfire.  Diane suggests that the rest of the gang spend <b>Thanksgiving</b> together in Carla&#39;s new home. Carla agrees to a potluck dinner, with Norm in charge of the humongous turkey. Woody, Cliff and Frasier are solo for the day, but Sam is to bring his date Wendy and Norm is to bring his never seen wife <b>Vera</b>.
