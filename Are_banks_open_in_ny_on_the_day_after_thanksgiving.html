The popular Thanksgiving tradition situates the first Thanksgiving celebration in North America in the year 1621.  The First Thanksgiving in <b>1621</b> was a significant event in its celebration and the remarkable assembly it garnered.

Although there is evidence of earlier <b>thanksgiving</b> celebrations in the Americas by the Spanish in the 16th century and at the Jamestown Colony of Virginia in 1610, following what is known as the &ldquo;starving times&rdquo; of 1609, these are not recognized as the &ldquo;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo;, a term coined by the editor Alexander Young in 1841 referring ...

So what really happened on the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621? ... In fact, historians can rely on only a few pieces of textual evidence to rebuild the <b>events</b>, including from Plymouth Colony Governor ...  Nearly all of what historians have learned about one of the first Thanksgiving comes from a single eyewitness report: a letter written in December <b>1621</b> by Edward Winslow, one of the 100 or so... </p>        <p>Traditoin president pardons a turkey thanksgiving.
