        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving market holidays Alton brown thanksgiving npr</strong></h2>
        <p>We&rsquo;re taking a look at the wait times from <b>Monday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>28th</b>, which was the first day after Thanksgiving Break. On that day, it looks like things have begun to drop back into a normal range &mdash; not a single wait time got above 2 hours, according to the hourly reports!  We headed to Magic Kingdom a little <b>after</b> <b>7AM</b>. Here&rsquo;s what the entrance crowds looked like &mdash; honestly, that&rsquo;s not too bad at all. When we arrived on Main Street, U.S.A. at around 7:20AM, we noticed that the Early Entry crowds had arrived.  On the day after Thanksgiving, <b>Epcot</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> Holidays Around the World festivities start. Consequently, we&rsquo;re going to deter to our Ultimate Guide to <b>Christmas</b> at Walt Disney World for recommendations of seasonal (read: Christmas) entertainment on Thanksgiving.  Curious about the park hours for MK on November 30th (the Saturday <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>). That&rsquo;s the first park <b>day</b> of our upcoming trip, and the fact that they &ldquo;only&rdquo; extended the hours to 9am to 10pm (which is less than the previous 3 weeks) is making me wonder whether they&rsquo;re expecting a steep dropoff in attendance that <b>day</b> like last year, or that this is just an incremental change ...  If you&rsquo;ve got plans to visit Disney <b>World</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b>, though, we&rsquo;ve got some great news: you have lots of dining spots where you can grab <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner. If you want to have a traditional Turkey <b>Day</b> dinner in Magic Kingdom, well, look no further than Liberty Tree Tavern and The Diamond Horseshoe, where&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> year-round.  Here are the Frog Family&rsquo;s best tips for making <b>Thanksgiving</b> at Disney <b>World</b> an enjoyable one! 1. Pick Your Park Wisely. If you&#39;re headed to Thanksgiving at Disney <b>World</b>, you want to pay even closer attention to our Crowd Calendar, so you can pick the best day to visit.  It&rsquo;s the week after a very busy Thanksgiving weekend, so let&rsquo;s check in on how busy the Disney World parks are! Bright, sunny <b>Cinderella</b> Castle! The holidays are a super popular time for people to visit Disney World, but it&rsquo;s still early December, and we never know when the parks are gonna have unexpectedly busy days!  <b>Thanksgiving</b> at Walt Disney <b>World</b> is known for its high crowds, festive ambiance, and an extra sprinkle of Disney magic. ... priced at a staggering $449 per person for <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> at Magic ...  The <b>Epcot</b> Festival of the Holidays typically begins the day after Thanksgiving and continues through the end of December. Even though November typically begins a gradual cool off, storms (especially mid-day storms) and high heat and humidity can still be a factor, so plan accordingly. </p>        <p>Crochet thanksgiving meme.
