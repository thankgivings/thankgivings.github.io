        <p>Learn the <b>history</b> and origin of Thanksgiving <b>Day</b>, including the symbols related to the holiday and facts about the Presidential Proclamation.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a popular North American holiday that is central to the origin story of the United States. It is traditionally said to have begun with the Plymouth <b>Thanksgiving </b>in 1621, but other <b>Thanksgiving </b>celebrations may have taken place earlier.  Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in <b>October</b> and <b>November</b> in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of <b>1621</b>.  Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> became an official U.S. holiday in 1863, and in 1942 the federal government designated the fourth Thursday in November as Thanksgiving. A traditional Thanksgiving meal consists of turkey, cranberries, bread stuffing, and pumpkin pie, among other dishes.  Thanksgiving is a U.S. holiday celebrated each <b>year</b> at the end of <b>November</b>. Learn about the history of Thanksgiving, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1863</b>, buoyed by the Union victory at Gettysburg, President Lincoln proclaimed that November 26, would be a national Thanksgiving Day, to be observed every year on the fourth Thursday of November. Only twice has a president changed the day of observation.  This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such in 1863. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving temperature history.
