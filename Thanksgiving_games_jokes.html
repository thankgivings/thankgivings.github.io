        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving games jokes Black thanksgiving new orleans</strong></h2>
        <p>In 1789, President George Washington became the first president to proclaim a <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b>, when, at the request of Congress, he proclaimed November 26, a Thursday, as a day of...  For two <b>years</b> two days were celebrated as Thanksgiving - the President and part of the nation celebrated it on the second to last Thursday <b>in</b> <b>November</b>, while the rest of the country celebrated it the following week. To end the confusion, Congress decided to set a fixed-date for the holiday.  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1863</b>, during the Civil War, Lincoln proclaimed a national day of thanksgiving to be celebrated on Thursday, November 26. The holiday was annually proclaimed by every president thereafter, and the date chosen, with few exceptions, was the last Thursday in November.  It didn&rsquo;t start with a single official declaration or a neat historical moment. Instead, it took years of effort, and the persistence of one determined woman, to make Thanksgiving the nationwide holiday we celebrate today. The First Thanksgiving <b>1621</b>, oil on canvas by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris (1899). Early Days: Thanksgiving Before It Was Official  Hale was from New England where, by the mid-19th century, celebrating and giving thanks for abundant autumn harvests was an <b>established</b> tradition. She finally had success when in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln declared <b>Thanksgiving</b> a <b>national</b> <b>holiday</b> on the last Thursday in November.  On <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1789</b>, President George Washington issued a proclamation naming Thursday, November 26, 1789, as an official holiday of &quot;sincere and humble thanks.&quot; The nation then celebrated its first Thanksgiving under its new Constitution.  It wasn&rsquo;t <b>until</b> <b>1863</b>, in the midst of the Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national Thanksgiving Day to be held each November. But the holiday is not without controversy.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>as a national</b> <b>holiday</b> owes its origins to Sarah Josepha Hale, who lobbied Abraham Lincoln&mdash;and wrote &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday observed on the fourth Thursday in November. It began <b>in</b> <b>1621</b> as a harvest celebration between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag Indians and has become a time for families and friends to gather to reflect and to express gratitude. </p>        <p>Buca di beppo lombard thanksgiving.
