        <p>Preheat the oven to 325&deg;F. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions, celery and mushrooms and <b>cook</b> until tender, about 8 minutes. Remove the mixture from the heat and stir in the chicken broth, parsley, sage, salt, poultry seasoning and pepper.  Stuffing is cooked inside the <b>turkey</b>, soaking up all the juices. Dressing is typically cooked separately from the turkey in a casserole dish with additional liquid. The two terms are used interchangeably, and it really depends on who you&rsquo;re asking.  Gather and prep all the ingredients. Brine the <b>turkey</b> breast half according to this Easy <b>Turkey</b> Brine Recipe. While the <b>turkey</b> breast is in the brine, <b>make</b> the traditional <b>stuffing</b>. Heat some of the butter in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and celery and <b>cook</b> until softened.  Here&rsquo;s <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>stuffing</b> <b>inside</b> the cavity of a <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>turkey</b> without overcooking the bird. Read on for the details.  This easy <b>stuffing</b> recipe is inspired by Grandma&#39;s because I never liked <b>Turkey</b> <b>Stuffing</b> till I tried hers! Her <b>turkey</b> <b>stuffing</b> is full of celery, onion, seasonings, and brown <b>turkey</b> meat, and it is packed with flavor and it&#39;s so satisfying!  Our recipe has just a few key stuffing spices: poultry <b>seasoning</b>, salt <b>and</b> black <b>pepper</b>. You&rsquo;ll also get flavor from the butter, onion, celery and chicken stock, but for the most part, all that savory flavor comes from poultry seasoning. We use a pre-mixed poultry seasoning that you can buy in the spice aisle at the grocery store.  You&#39;ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below &mdash; but here&#39;s a brief overview of what you can expect when you <b>make</b> this classic <b>turkey</b> <b>stuffing</b>: 1. <b>Make</b> Bread Crumbs: Spread the toasted bread slices on baking sheets. Allow them to sit at room temperature until they&#39;re hard, about 24 hours. When they&#39;re hard, crush the slices with a rolling pin.  Once you&rsquo;ve learned how to roast a stuffed <b>turkey</b>, customize it by adding diced apples, dried cranberries, or toasted pecans to your <b>stuffing</b> recipe, or swap this one out for a nostalgic...  Use these tips and tricks to learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>stuff</b> a <b>turkey</b>&mdash;<b>and</b> how to cook it safely without drying out the meat. Whether you call it stuffing or dressing, no Thanksgiving dinner is complete without this iconic side dish. </p>        <p>Walmart bowmanville hours thanksgiving.
