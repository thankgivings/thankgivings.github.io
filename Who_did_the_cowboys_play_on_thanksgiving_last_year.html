        <h2><strong>Who did the cowboys play on thanksgiving last year Grazie bothell thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Friday Sermon: <b>Thanksgiving</b> (Dr. Yahia Abdurahman ... We prepared this quick tour to help you get familiar with the new design so you find your way around the new site much quicker. Let&#39;s begin. Topics menu will always be here, always within reach. Here, you will find quick shortcuts to major topics &amp; hubs under IslamiCity.  <b>Muslims</b> give <b>thanks</b> to <b>God</b> all the time. Giving thanks to Allah and showing gratitude are not limited to a certain time of the year. Actually the life of a Muslim is all about thanksgiving and gratitude. A Muslim thanks Allah for creating him in the first place; he thanks Allah for guiding him to the right path of Islam.  In Islam, <b>thanksgiving</b> is not only a particular religious act or service; it is the whole life. The whole life should be lived in obedience to our Ultimate Benefactor, Allah. He has been good to us and so in our thankfulness we should worship Him, obey His commands and orders.  In Islam we have two forms of <b>thanksgiving</b>. The first is called hamd and the second is termed shukr. Hamd is to thank someone for something because they gave you something out of their generosity. When someone demonstrates kindness to you and doesn&rsquo;t expect anything in return from you, your thanking them is called hamd.  This American spirit of giving <b>thanks</b> is actually enshrined in Islam. In fact, Islam can be boiled down to two ideals: giving <b>thanks</b> to God and giving <b>thanks</b> to our fellow human beings. The Qur&rsquo;an tells us, &lsquo;Worship God and be thankful to Him,&rsquo; &ndash; The Holy Qur&rsquo;an 39:67. Some may say that ritual prayer and worship suffice to give <b>thanks</b> ...  When you say: &ldquo;Thank <b>You</b>&rdquo;, you&rsquo;re usually saying it to someone. So, who deserves our thanks, our gratitude, and our praise? Allah says in the Quran, &ldquo;In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. [All] praise is [due] to Allah, Lord of the worlds -&rdquo; [Noble Quran 1:1-2]  The simple answer: Islam <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> Thanksgiving, but Muslims might. Ibn&rsquo; Umar (RAA) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: &ldquo;He who imitates any people (in their actions) is considered to be one of them.&rdquo; Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban Book 16, Hadith 35.  It is said that <b>Thanksgiving</b> had roots in religious and cultural tradition but today <b>Thanksgiving</b> is primarily celebrated as a secular holiday. [1] In principle, imitating the disbelievers in any of their religious festivals (holidays) is totally impermissible and intolerable.  Can <b>Muslims</b> in USA celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>?
