        <p>The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623.  The <b>first</b> player hands an object &mdash; a toy, small pumpkin, etc. &mdash; backward over her head to the next player, who then passes it between his legs. Each player runs to the end of the line to continue passing the object until one team crosses the finish line.
