        <p>Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>dates to the days of the early American colonists and carries a rich, yet controversial, history. Explore the origins of the holiday. <b>Thanksgiving </b>is the annual holiday that takes place throughout the United States on the last Thursday of November.  Thanksgiving as a national holiday owes its <b>origins</b> to Sarah Josepha Hale, who lobbied Abraham Lincoln&mdash;and wrote &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;  In the modern consciousness, Thanksgiving is strongly associated with the near-mythological story of the <b>Pilgrims</b> at Plymouth (the English colonists) and their Wampanoag Indian neighbors, who shared a meal to celebrate the harvest in 1621.  This <b>1623</b> festival appears to have been the origin of our Thanksgiving Day because it combined a religious and social celebration. Festivals of Thanksgiving were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall <b>of</b> <b>1621</b>.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving </b>to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, November 28. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving theme elf yourself. Happy thanksgiving to my sister in heaven.
