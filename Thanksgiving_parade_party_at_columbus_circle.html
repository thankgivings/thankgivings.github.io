        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving parade party at columbus circle Berkeley thanksgiving run</strong></h2>
        <p>What is the date of the First Thanksgiving? The First Thanksgiving is dated <b>to</b> <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday? Thanksgiving became an American holiday in 1863 but was not observed in every state until after 1963. Why do Native Americans object to Thanksgiving?  How did Thanksgiving become a national holiday? Sarah Josepha Hale campaigned for a national thanksgiving holiday in the United States during the <b>19th</b> century, eventually winning President Abraham Lincoln &rsquo;s support <b>in</b> <b>1863</b>.  <b>On</b> <b>September</b> <b>28</b>, <b>1789</b>, just before leaving for recess, the first Federal Congress passed a resolution asking that the President of the United States recommend to the nation a day of thanksgiving.  Lincoln wasn&#39;t the <b>first</b> president to issue a <b>Thanksgiving</b> proclamation &mdash; George Washington <b>did</b> it in 1789. Lincoln&#39;s order, however, set a precedent for observing <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the last ...  <b>On</b> <b>June</b> <b>28</b>, <b>1870</b>, President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law the Holidays Act that made Thanksgiving a yearly &quot;appointed or remembered&quot; federal holiday in Washington D.C. Three other holidays included in the law were New Year , Christmas , and July 4.  President George Washington was the first to issue a proclamation for the holiday <b>in</b> 1789, designating <b>Thursday</b>, November 26 &ldquo;for the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving.&rdquo; This marked the first national celebration of the holiday under the new Constitution. &ldquo;A Proclamation.&rdquo;  The first official proclamation of a national Thanksgiving holiday didn&rsquo;t come <b>until</b> <b>1863</b>, when President Abraham Lincoln called for an annual Thanksgiving celebration on the final Thursday in...  Several days of <b>Thanksgiving</b> were held in early New England history that have been identified as the &quot;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot;, including Pilgrim <b>holidays</b> in Plymouth in 1621 and 1623, and a Puritan <b>holiday</b> in Boston in 1631.  But <b>did</b> you know that this hasn&rsquo;t always been the case? In the past, <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been celebrated on different Thursdays in November, and in the early days of our country, it was even celebrated in different months! The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> national <b>holiday</b> was on Thursday, November 26, 1789. </p>        <p>Groupon thanksgiving dinner san francisco. <a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/248.html">Thanksgiving 2024 b</a>.
