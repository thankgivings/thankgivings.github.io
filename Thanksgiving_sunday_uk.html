        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving sunday uk Quotes about drinking on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>When and <b>why</b> has <b>Thanksgiving</b> been observed <b>in Canada</b>? The first national <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in Canada</b> was celebrated in the Province of <b>Canada</b> in 1859. It was organized at the behest of leaders of the Protestant clergy, who appropriated the holiday of American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which was first observed in 1777 and established as a national day of ...  Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is rooted in Indigenous values, including giving thanks for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. First Nations traditions would include feasting, prayer, dance and other ceremonies. However, the concept of <b>thanksgiving</b> was influenced by our American neighbours.  <b>Canada</b> celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> decades before the Pilgrims, but the holiday in the U.S. and its northern neighbor have much in common.  Some historians argue that the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> in North America took place <b>in Canada</b> in 1578, following Martin Frobisher&rsquo;s safe arrival in Newfoundland after a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage. Even earlier, Indigenous Peoples had their own traditions for honoring the Earth&rsquo;s abundance during the fall season.  It may be surprising to hear that Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is actually older than its southern counterpart&#39;s celebration. There are also some differences between how the holidays are celebrated across borders. Here&#39;s <b>why</b> Canadians celebrate, and how they get together to make the holiday happen. <b>Why</b> do Canadians celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>?  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its celebration here in <b>Canada</b>, given that we will all be celebrating on October 14th. We all learned as children about the American Thanksgiving myth of the first US Thanksgiving but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  Believe it or not, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in Canada</b>, or at least the land that would become <b>Canada</b>, has its own history, separate from our American counterparts. Traditions of giving thanks long predate the arrival of European settlers in North America.  What&#39;s the difference between Thanksgiving in America and Thanksgiving in <b>Canada</b>? In the United States, Thanksgiving is <b>celebrated</b> on the fourth Thursday of November but in Canada, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.).  Since 1957, Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been celebrated on the second Monday of October. This change was made to separate the celebration of the harvest from the Remembrance Day commemorations of Canadian War veterans held in November. </p>        <p><i>Thanksgiving sunday uk</i>.
