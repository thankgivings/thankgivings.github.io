        <p>How crowded is Disney World during Thanksgiving week? The answer <b>is</b>, <b>very</b>! Thanksgiving week at Disney World is one of the most popular times to visit, and as a result it does get crowded. With this in mind, it&rsquo;s best not to leave your Disney experience to chance.  Though Thanksgiving week is definitely considered a busy time at Disney World, <b>it</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> not nearly as <b>crowded</b> as other times of year &ndash; like Christmas. Throughout the week, crowds continue to build, with the Saturday-Wednesday before Thanksgiving generally being slightly less busy than Thursday-Sunday.  As predicted, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was the busiest week of this year at Walt <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b>&hellip;so far. This <b>crowd</b> report shares recent wait time data, the degree to which there was a post-holiday hangover, and thoughts on what&rsquo;s likely to happen next with attendance this week and in early December 2021 at Walt <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b>.

You&#39;ll save time waiting in line for food if you eat during off-peak times. Eat an early breakfast and have an early lunch at 11 <b>a</b>.<b>m</b>. Alternatively, eat a big breakfast and have a late lunch.  In this ULTIMATE <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> guide we cover everything you need to know about celebrating <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>at Disney</b> <b>World</b> and answer all your burning questions such as is <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b> open on <b>Thanksgiving</b>, is <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b> <b>busy</b> on <b>thanksgiving</b> <b>day</b>, which park is best to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> in and of course where to have ...
