        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving poem spiritual Thanksgiving point light of christ</strong></h2>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what the Pilgrims <b>ate</b> at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  So <b>what foods</b> were served <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  From <b>seafood</b> to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the first Thanksgiving probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  What Was on the Menu at the First Thanksgiving? Traditional Thanksgiving dinner includes <b>turkey</b>, stuffing and mashed potatoes but the First Thanksgiving likely included wildfowl, <b>corn</b>, porridge...  <b>Turkey</b>, <b>corn</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> are all Thanksgiving staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the first Thanksgiving? The answer might surprise you!  Plus the easy-to-gather local <b>food</b>: <b>clams</b>, lobsters, cod, eels, onions, turnips and greens from spinach to chard. So how did turkey get to be the Thanksgiving bird? Gradually.  What Did the Pilgrims Eat on the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Many dishes served during modern Thanksgiving meals were not present at the first Thanksgiving. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have potatoes, nor did they have butter or flour necessary for making pies.  For most people, <b>enjoying</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>. But how did the Pilgrims...  There are only two surviving documents that reference the original Thanksgiving harvest meal. They describe a feast of freshly killed <b>deer</b>, assorted <b>wildfowl</b>, a bounty of cod and <b>bass</b>, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn bread and porridge. </p>        <p>Cajun thanksgiving food.
