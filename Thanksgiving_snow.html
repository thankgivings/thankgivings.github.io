        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving snow Thanksgiving day race photos</strong></h2>
        <p>From <b>seafood</b> to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  But if one were to create a historically accurate feast, consisting of only those <b>foods </b>that historians are certain were <b>served at the </b>so-called &ldquo;<b>first Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; there <b>would </b>be slimmer...  There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest meal. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn bread and porridge.  For most people, <b>enjoying</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, <b>and</b> <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>. But how did the Pilgrims...  &quot;Sobaheg&quot; means stew in the Wampanoag <b>language</b>, and there&#39;s a good chance it was served as part of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal. A traditional autumn sobaheg contains a mixture of cooked beans, corn, squash, and nuts, all seasoned with salt.  So <b>what foods</b> were <b>served</b> <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may <b>have</b> fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  The meal usually thought of as the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> took place sometime around the harvest season in 1621 at the Plymouth Plantation in modern-day Massachusetts. But it shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise that the menu that day doesn&rsquo;t <b>have</b> all that much in common with the staples of a modern one.  Since the historic meal in 1621, <b>Thanksgiving</b> traditions <b>have</b> changed and evolved with American culture. From turkey and stuffing to potatoes and pies, we know what dishes to expect at our holiday tables today, but you might be surprised to learn <b>what foods</b> the Pilgrims and Wampanoag brought to the table and what didn&rsquo;t make the cut.  Have you ever wondered what the Pilgrims ate at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal. </p>        <p>Thank god ka passive. Ex girlfriends mother invited me to thanksgiving.
