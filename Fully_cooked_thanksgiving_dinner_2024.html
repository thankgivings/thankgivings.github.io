There are many traditional and new celebrations.  Traditionally, <b>Thanksgiving</b> and Christmas are not celebrated in China. <b>Thanksgiving</b> (感恩节 Gǎn&#39;ēnji&eacute;) is essentially a North American holiday, existing mainly in the United States and Canada. People do not celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> in China. The closest thing to it among <b>Chinese</b> holidays is the Mid-Autumn Festival.  Mid-Autumn Festival (also known as Moon Festival) is a <b>Chinese</b> <b>harvest</b> holiday. It has been compared to the Western holiday of Thanksgiving. Read about mooncakes, the legend of Chang&#39;e, and more.  Thanksgiving Day is widely celebrated in the US and Canada. &ldquo;<b>gǎn</b> ēn ji&eacute;&rdquo; is a Chinese word for Thanksgiving day, which means &ldquo;to feel thankful&rdquo; + &ldquo;holiday.&rdquo; Learn five essential Chinese words and make this opportunity worth it.  In China, Mid-Autumn Festival is a reunion time for families, a little like <b>Thanksgiving</b>. <b>Chinese</b> people celebrate it by gathering for dinners, worshiping the moon, lighting paper lanterns, eating moon cakes, etc. It is also celebrated by many other countries, such as America (mainly in the Asian American community), Singapore, and Malaysia.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a traditional festival in the Western world, but do you know there are also some festivals about expressing gratitude in China?
