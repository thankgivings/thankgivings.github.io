        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving with paula deen 94th aero squadron thanksgiving menu</strong></h2>
        <p>Pair it with turkey for <b>Thanksgiving</b>, or eat it as an all-in-one meal any time of the year. Stuffing is a classic Thanksgiving side <b>dish</b>, but for some reason, my family never served it during the holidays. My husband&rsquo;s family, however, never had a Thanksgiving dinner without it.  <b>Stuffing</b> has always been my favorite side dish for the holiday meal, and this is my family&rsquo;s best <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Stuffing</b> <b>recipe</b>. It has fresh Italian pork <b>sausage</b>, fresh herbs, lots of butter, and veggies, and it uses ciabatta bread for the best texture. It&rsquo;s simple, classic, and easy! This could be my whole <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner, right here.  Our favorite <b>Thanksgiving</b> side dish is a really, really good pan of homemade <b>sausage</b> stuffing. We want pure, classic, bready, herby goodness. And that&rsquo;s exactly what this recipe yields. Oh, and it&rsquo;s easy, too! Here&rsquo;s everything you&rsquo;ll need to make it: What Is the Difference Between <b>Dressing</b> and Stuffing?  Looking for a classic <b>sausage</b> stuffing that puts any boxed mix to shame? This from-scratch <b>sausage</b> stuffing <b>recipe</b> is decadent and delicious, can easily be made ahead, and is perfect for your <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner, or any special meal!  <b>Sausage</b>: This <b>recipe</b> <b>starts</b> with a pound of breakfast sausage. Butter: Cook the vegetables in a mix of butter and sausage drippings. Vegetables: You&rsquo;ll need finely diced celery and a chopped onion. Bread: The white bread cubes should ideally be slightly stale. If your bread seems too soft, lightly toast it in the oven.  Side dishes really can steal the show. This full-flavored <b>sausage</b> stuffing <b>recipe</b> is bound to be a hit at <b>Thanksgiving</b>, or any other celebration. A classic combination of onion, <b>celery</b>,...  Bring <b>sausage</b> <b>stuffing</b> to the <b>Thanksgiving</b> table and everyone will want a second scoop! This hearty side dish <b>recipe</b> may even outshine the turkey.
