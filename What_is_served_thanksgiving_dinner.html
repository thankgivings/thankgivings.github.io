        <p>When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, <b>turkey</b> is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>did</b> <b>eat</b> <b>turkey</b> in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford.

The Wampanoag guests brought five deer with them, so venison was on the menu. The English brought fowl, &quot;probably migrating waterfowl like ducks...  According to Texas A&amp;M University, pilgrims at their first thanksgiving <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>eat</b> <b>turkey</b>. Historians say that the menu included in the first event included &ldquo;fowle&rdquo; which refer to a number...  There&rsquo;s a good chance the Pilgrims and <b>Wampanoag</b> did in fact eat turkey as part of that very first Thanksgiving. Wild turkey was a common food source for people who settled Plymouth. In the days prior to the celebration, the colony&rsquo;s governor sent four men to go &ldquo;fowling&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to hunt for birds.
