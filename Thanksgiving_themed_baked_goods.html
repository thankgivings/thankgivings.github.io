        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.

Bradford writes:  While the settlers at Plymouth and their allies from the Wampanoag tribe really did get together in <b>1621</b> for a table-groaning, three-day feast to celebrate the settlers&#39; first harvest, that&#39;s...  Learn the history and <b>origin</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, including the symbols related to the holiday and facts about the Presidential Proclamation.  This <b>1623</b> festival appears to have been the origin of our Thanksgiving Day because it combined a religious and social celebration.
