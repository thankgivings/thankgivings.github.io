        <h2><strong>A thanksgiving grace before meals Thanksgiving basket announcement</strong></h2>
        <p>The next year, they instituted those days and made them holidays of praise and thanksgiving. <b>Shabbat</b> 21b. The story of the miracle of the oil that lasted for eight days is, perhaps, the most well known of Hanukkah&rsquo;s origin stories. It&rsquo;s what is usually found in children&rsquo;s books, told in Hebrew schools and recalled at Hanukkah parties.  When Does <b>Hanukkah</b> Start in 2024? Chanukah (<b>Hanukkah</b>) 2024 starts at nightfall on December 25, 2024 and ends with nightfall on January 2, 2025 , beginning on the Hebrew calendar date of 25 Kislev , and lasting for eight days.  This <b>year</b>, <b>Nov</b>. <b>28</b> is Thanksgiving and the first full day of the eight-day Jewish festival of lights, which begins at sundown the previous night.  <b>Hanukkah</b> (Chanukah), the Jewish eight-day &ldquo;festival of lights&rdquo; is celebrated with a nightly menorah lighting--adding a flame each night--special prayers, dreidel playing, and fried foods. What Does Chanukah Actually Mean? What Is a Dreidel? How Many Candles On a Menorah (Chanukiah)? What Is Gelt?  But, using the Chabad.org Date Converter, you will see that Thanksgiving coincided with the first day of Chanukah <b>on</b> <b>November</b> <b>29</b>, <b>1888</b>. It also coincided with the fourth day of Chanukah on November 30, 1899. On November 28, 1918, Thanksgiving was on Chanukah eve.  The first day of <b>Hanukkah</b> marks the start of Hanukkah, also known as Chanukah or Festival of Lights. Hanukkah is an eight-day Jewish observance that remembers the Jewish people&#39;s struggle for religious freedom.  <b>Hanukkah</b> falls on the eve of the 25th of the Jewish month of Kislev and lasts eight days. That lands it somewhere in December on the Gregorian calendar (though in 2013 it fell on <b>Thanksgiving</b> in November, an extremely rare occurrence). Also called the Festival of Lights, <b>Hanukkah</b> celebrates events from more than 2,000 years ago.  While <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a <b>day</b> of gratitude for the harvest, <b>Hanukkah</b> is a time to celebrate religious freedom, the rabbi added. According to history, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>first</b> took place with the Pilgrims who came to America in search of free religious exercise.  There are several traditions and customs that celebrate <b>Hanukkah</b>, including prayers of thanksgiving, lighting Hanukkah candles, eating traditional fried Hanukkah <b>foods</b>, and plenty of fun games and songs. </p>        <p><a href="./250.html">Food network thanksgiving competition shows</a>.
