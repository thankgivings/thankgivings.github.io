        <h2><strong>Turkey thanksgiving football Best thanksgiving day traditions</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving is a day for a traditional menu, and I take a holiday by reprinting this annual column on the origins of the day: The first presidential proclamation of Thanksgiving as a national holiday was issued by George Washington on October <b>3</b>, 1789. But it was a one-time event.  On October 3, 1863, he issued a proclamation declaring the last Thursday of November to be National <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day. He ordered all government offices in <b>Washington</b> to close on that day. <b>Hale</b> enjoyed many <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations after that. She died on April 30, 1879, at the age of 90.  Sarah Josepha <b>Hale</b>, seen in an 1850 engraving, believed Thanksgiving could be a unifying force in American life.  Well over a century before Sarah Josepha <b>Hale</b> was born, the &ldquo;first&rdquo; <b>Thanksgiving</b> was celebrated by the Pilgrims in the autumn of 1621 following a successful harvest. After that, days of &ldquo;<b>thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; became common across New England, and some early presidents, including <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> and John Adams, also declared &ldquo;days of thanks.&rdquo;  In her novel Northwood: Or, a Tale of New England, Hale devotes an entire chapter to describing the many dishes of <b>Thanksgiving</b>&mdash;<b>roasted</b> turkey, gravy and savory stuffing, chicken pie, pumpkin pie, pickles, cakes and preserves&mdash;and to drink ginger beer, currant wine and cider.  <b>Hale</b> had already spent years campaigning for a national day of <b>thanksgiving</b>, using her platform as editor of one the country&#39;s most widely-read magazines and writing elected officials to argue...  Sarah Josepha <b>Hale</b>, a popular author, especially of children&#39;s poetry, and an influential magazine editor, had tried and failed to get four successive U.S. presidents to proclaim Thanksgiving a national holiday to be celebrated on the last Thursday in November, according to NPR. And then her request hit home in 1863.  In 1789, a newly inaugurated <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> called for a national day of thanks to celebrate both the end of the war and the recent ratification of the U.S. Constitution.  Two years after the official establishment of the United States, President <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> issued a proclamation Oct. <b>3</b>, 1789, at the recommendation of Congress for a public day of giving &ldquo;sincere and humble thanks&rdquo; &mdash; for the nation and its &ldquo;tranquility, union, and plenty.&rdquo; </p>        <p>Is fedex delivering thanksgiving day.
