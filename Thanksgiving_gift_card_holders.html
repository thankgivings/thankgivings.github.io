I know you will be <b>missing</b> your <b>Mom</b>&#39;<b>s</b> presence (and her fantastic pumpkin cheesecake)! Love to you all!  Next week I will celebrate the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> without <b>Mom</b>. I decided to share a few stories as a tribute to her as we head into the holiday season. There are so many blessings I received from my mom over the years, but one that really stands out is all the ways she cooked and ran errands for me and Kyle when I was too weak to do those tasks ...  Here&#39;s how I survived my <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> without my <b>Mom</b>. The first step in surviving the first Thanksgiving without <b>Mom</b> <b>was</b> acknowledging the pain. It&#39;s okay to feel sad, to miss her, and to grieve. It&#39;s okay to cry and express your feelings. It&#39;s a part of the healing process. I allowed myself to feel the pain, to remember her, and to miss her.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> without a loved one is truly difficult, and there is no escaping the fact that it will stir up a multitude of memories and resurface grief in a whole new way.  For someone who is experiencing their <b>first</b> major holiday without someone they loved deeply, the occasion is anything but merry and bright. Don&#39;t ignore people who are grieving a fresh loss during the holidays, but choose your words carefully.  For those experiencing loss, a change in circumstances, isolation or loneliness, the holiday season is a reminder of what we might be <b>missing</b> and how we come up short. The <b>first</b> year after losing someone, there is a list of firsts: the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> without them at the table, the <b>first</b> birthday or anniversary that passes.  This is our <b>first</b> <b>thanksgiving</b> without <b>mom</b>. Well, the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> without her physically here. Over her nine years living with dementia, there was always a new type of loss every year.  My heart hurts for you, this was also my <b>first</b> <b>thanksgiving</b> without my <b>mom</b>.
