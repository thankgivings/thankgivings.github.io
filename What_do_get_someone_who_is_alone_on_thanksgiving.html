        <h2><strong>What do get someone who is alone on thanksgiving George washington thanksgiving whereas it is the duty</strong></h2>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what the Pilgrims ate at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  So what foods were <b>served</b> at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to food historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  Neither Bradford or Winslow&rsquo;s writing reveal what was actually served at the first Thanksgiving meal, besides <b>fowl</b> and deer, but guesses can be made based on the types of food they often wrote about such <b>as</b> <b>mussels</b>, <b>lobsters</b>, <b>grapes</b>, <b>plums</b>, <b>corn</b> and <b>herbs</b>.  &quot;<b>Sobaheg</b>&quot; means stew in the Wampanoag language, and there&#39;s a good chance it was served as part of the first Thanksgiving meal. A traditional autumn sobaheg contains a mixture of cooked beans, corn, squash, and nuts, all seasoned with salt.  Corn was <b>first</b> domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the lowlands of southwest Mexico by selectively breeding a native grass called teosinte. This early corn was grown for some 4,000 years, at which time farmers crossed it with a different strain of teosinte from the mountains of central Mexico, greatly improving yields.  There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest meal. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn bread and porridge.  What Was on the Menu at the First Thanksgiving? Traditional Thanksgiving dinner <b>includes</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>stuffing</b> and <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b> but the First Thanksgiving likely included <b>wildfowl</b>,...  From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  <b>Turkey</b>, <b>corn</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> are all Thanksgiving staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the first Thanksgiving?
