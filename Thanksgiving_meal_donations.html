        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving meal donations Thanksgiving cornbread stuffing recipes</strong></h2>
        <p>Also referred to as Blackout <b>Wednesday</b> or Black <b>Wednesday</b>, Drinksgiving has likely been around for decades, but it didn&#39;t get much recognition until around 2007, when the catchy term was coined.  &#39;Blackout <b>Wednesday</b>&#39;, aka &#39;Drinksgiving&#39;, is one of the biggest drinking days of the year, taking place the day <b>before</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> and poses many health risks.  Everyone knows the day after Thanksgiving is <b>Black</b> <b>Friday</b>, but the night before Thanksgiving has picked up its own nickname -- Blackout <b>Wednesday</b>.  Day and night before Thanksgiving (aka Black <b>Wednesday</b>, Awkward <b>Wednesday</b> or Whiskey Wednesday) are among most dangerous times on the road, traffic safety group says. Over 830 people died in...  Instead of a day invented by marketing firms and ad agencies to sell marked-up-and-slashed-down consumer goods, the <b>Wednesday</b> <b>before</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably organically developed its reputation as the biggest drinking night of the year.  According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), Thanksgiving is the most traveled day of the year and they&rsquo;ve dubbed Thanksgiving Eve &lsquo;Blackout <b>Wednesday</b>.&rsquo; Reasons for the night out can vary from enjoying time together to trying to find an excuse to not talk about politics.  Blackout <b>Wednesday</b> is the annual night before Thanksgiving dedicated to drinking. Let&#39;s look at the history of this debaucherous holiday to see how it started.  Yet, the night <b>before</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, known as &ldquo;Blackout <b>Wednesday</b>,&rdquo; has become one of the most dangerous nights of the year due to excessive alcohol consumption and its resulting consequences. What is Blackout <b>Wednesday</b>? Blackout <b>Wednesday</b>, also known as &ldquo;Drinksgiving,&rdquo; gets its name from the heavy drinking that often takes place on this night.  Also known as <b>Drinksgiving</b>, Blackout <b>Wednesday</b> or Black Wednesday has become the first drinking weekend of the holiday season. In many ways, it rivals New Year&rsquo;s Eve and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in the amount of alcohol people end up consuming. </p>        <p><a href="./122.html">Bruiser thanksgiving 2024</a>.
