        <h2><strong>Prayer of praise thanksgiving and petition Gold and white thanksgiving table settings</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> traditions have come and gone through the years, but one tradition that has long played a central role in <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations is the enjoyment of a hearty meal, as can be seen in articles, recipes, and advertisements in magazines and newspapers throughout the <b>1800s</b> and 1900s.  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as Spanish and English days of feasting and prayer to become the football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today. English...  By the <b>1800s</b>, stuffed turkeys were common on <b>Thanksgiving</b> tables; recipes for stuffing appeared in Amelia Simmons&#39;s 1796 American Cookery, considered America&#39;s first cookbook. Today, whether you cook it inside or outside the bird, stuffing (like the Sausage Stuffing with Sage you see above) is still a must-have side.  In fact, sweet potatoes have been part of the American cuisine for generations and in the late <b>1800s</b>, sweet potatoes were being candied or glazed to act as a Thanksgiving side. But it wasn&#39;t until 1917 when marshmallows entered the scene.  So how did the <b>Thanksgiving</b> menu evolve into what it is today? Wall explains that the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday, as we know it, took root in the mid-19th century.  For more than two centuries, days of <b>thanksgiving</b> were celebrated by individual colonies and states. It wasn&rsquo;t until 1863, in the midst of the Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed...  President James Madison proclaimed a day of Thanksgiving to be held on April <b>13</b>, <b>1815</b>, the last such proclamation issued by a President until Abraham Lincoln did so in 1862. Most of the credit for the establishment of an annual Thanksgiving holiday may be given to Sarah Josepha Hale.  Originally an English tradition, days of <b>thanksgiving</b> typically were marked by religious services to give thanks to God, or to celebrate a bountiful harvest. The first recorded religious...  Erica Boynton, Remick museum program manager, says a typical New England <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal of the period included a rich assortment of simple, seasonal foods, with ample vegetables, wild game, fish and other meats &mdash; and, of course, several pies. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving wood cutouts for placemats.
