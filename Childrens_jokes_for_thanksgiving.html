Though the US version takes place on the fourth Thursday of November, <b>Canada </b>celebrates on the second...  Here is how <b>Canada</b> celebrates their big holiday as well as four ways that the Canadian and U.S. Thanksgivings differ. 1. Canadian Thanksgiving is in October&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian Thanksgiving happens a full month and a half before American Thanksgiving, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  The first Thanksgiving after Confederation was observed on 5 April 1872. A national civic holiday rather than a religious one, it was held to celebrate the recovery of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) from an illness. Thanksgiving was first observed as an annual event in <b>Canada</b> on 6 November 1879.  Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving on the second Monday in October, while Thanksgiving in the United States is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November. When is Thanksgiving in <b>Canada</b>?

[1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian <b>Thanksgiving </b>to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  What&#39;s the difference between Thanksgiving in America and Thanksgiving in <b>Canada</b>? In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November but in Canada, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.).  Quick Info: Thanksgiving in Canada is celebrated each year on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b>. Thanksgiving has its roots in the European Harvest Festivals where people celebrated an abundant harvest and shared their food within their community.  Thanksgiving Day in <b>Canada</b> has been a holiday on the second Monday of October since 1957. It is a chance for people to give thanks for a good harvest and other fortunes in the past year.
