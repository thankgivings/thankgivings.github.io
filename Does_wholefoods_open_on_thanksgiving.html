        <h2><strong>Does wholefoods open on thanksgiving How many indians were killed on thanksgiving day</strong></h2>
        <p>The cornucopia is typically a hollow, <b>horn</b>-shaped wicker basket filled with various seasonal fruits and vegetables. Though most Americans associate the cornucopia with the <b>Thanksgiving </b>holiday, it was around long before Columbus sailed to America.  Also called the &ldquo;horn of <b>plenty</b>,&rdquo; a cornucopia is a horn-shaped container filled with fruits of the harvest. Being that Thanksgiving originated from Native American harvest celebrations, it&rsquo;s no surprise this Greek symbol of the harvest found its way into Thanksgiving symbols.  But how did this ornamental container become associated with Thanksgiving? The story traces back to a mythical goat in ancient times. A <b>horn</b> with history. The cornucopia first shows up around 3,000 years ago, in the story of Amalthea.  The modern cornucopia is typically a hollow, <b>horn</b>-shaped wicker basket filled with festive fruit and vegetables and has become closely tied to <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The first <b>Thanksgiving </b>was actually a celebration <b>of </b>the fall harvest and was a three-day festival between the Puritan Pilgrims and the Native Americans.  The cornucopia is a ubiquitous symbol <b>of </b>abundance, especially around <b>Thanksgiving</b>, starring in centerpieces on bountiful tables across the land. But where did the &ldquo;<b>horn of </b>plenty&rdquo; originate? A <b>Thanksgiving </b>cornucopia has a much longer, more elaborate history than you may imagine.  The cornerstone of Thanksgiving decor is the <b>not</b>-<b>so</b>-<b>humble</b> cornucopia: a horn whose broad opening overflows with the fruits of a bountiful harvest. Today the symbol may seem as American as,...  Every Thanksgiving, the <b>horn</b>-<b>shaped</b> cornucopia, a curving basket overflowing with fruit, nuts, and vegetables, appears on tables as part of the holiday decor. But where did this unique-looking symbol originate? And why do we see it everywhere during harvest season?  While we can all agree that <b>food </b>and family are the most important elements <b>of Thanksgiving</b>, the cornucopia is a symbol that has come to represent the holiday while also giving the table a finished and festive look when used as DIY <b>Thanksgiving </b>centerpieces.  The cornucopia has long been a symbol <b>of </b>the <b>Thanksgiving </b>season &mdash; a large (often wicker) <b>horn </b>overflowing with fruits and vegetables and grains. It&rsquo;s also known as the <b>horn of </b>plenty, and for good reason. The word cornucopia comes from the Latin cornu &ldquo;<b>horn</b>&rdquo; (also the source <b>of </b>unicorn) and copiae &ldquo;abundance.&rdquo; </p>        <p>El paso thanksgiving parade route.
