        <h2><strong>Who hosts thanksgiving in your family Aarp thanksgiving table talk</strong></h2>
        <p>Here is how Canada celebrates their big holiday as well as four ways that the Canadian and U.S. Thanksgivings differ. 1. Canadian Thanksgiving <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>October</b>&mdash;<b>and</b> on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian Thanksgiving happens a full month and a half before American Thanksgiving, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  What&#39;s the difference between Thanksgiving in America and Thanksgiving in Canada? In the United States, Thanksgiving <b>is</b> <b>celebrated</b> <b>on</b> the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b> but in Canada, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.).  Perhaps the most apparent difference between Canadian and American Thanksgiving is the date. In Canada, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October, while in the United States, it&#39;s observed on the fourth Thursday of November. Why the difference? Well, it&rsquo;s mainly due to the <b>holiday</b>&#39;<b>s</b> different origins.  Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is not as exciting as American <b>Thanksgiving</b>&mdash;<b>there</b> are no massive parades, no big bargains to chase, it&#39;s not the busiest day of the year in the airports. Just food,...  Canadian <b>Thanksgiving </b>has some unique origins that separate it from the American holiday, predating the United States <b>Thanksgiving </b>holiday <b>in </b>Plymouth Plantation by 43 years. <b>Canada</b>&rsquo;s holiday was initially created to express thanks for explorers&rsquo; safe voyages into the New World.  Many of the trappings of Canadian Thanksgiving are similar to those of its U.S. counterpart, but the Canadian tradition belongs to the <b>16th</b> <b>century</b>, more than four decades before the historic...  The meaning ascribed to <b>Thanksgiving</b> is slightly <b>different</b> between <b>Canada</b> and the <b>U.S</b>. Historically in <b>Canada</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations commemorated everything from explorer Martin Frobisher&rsquo;s successful 1578 crossing of the Northwest Passage to victories during the World Wars, whereas the emphasis in the <b>U.S</b>. is on pilgrims and the Mayflower.  From our work cultures to our diets, there are certainly plenty of ways we&#39;re similar-yet-different &mdash; and Thanksgiving is no exception. Canadian Thanksgiving takes place on the <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b>...  To honour Canadian Thanksgiving in 2022, we look at how Canada does Thanksgiving differently &ndash; from the history and the date to the food and traditions. 1. Canada <b>honours</b> a different Thanksgiving. There&rsquo;s a lot of debate around the first true Thanksgiving. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving stuffed crescent rolls. Little facts about thanksgiving.
