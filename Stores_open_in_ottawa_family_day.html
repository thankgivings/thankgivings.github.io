        <h2><strong>Stores open in ottawa family day The great thanksgiving anglican</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its celebration here in <b>Canada</b>, given that <b>we</b> will all be celebrating on October 14th. <b>We</b> all learned as children about the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> myth of the first US <b>Thanksgiving</b> but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  It may be surprising to hear that Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is actually older than its southern counterpart&#39;s celebration. There are also some differences between how the holidays are celebrated across borders. Here&#39;s why Canadians <b>celebrate</b>, and how they get together to make the holiday happen. Why do Canadians <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>?  When and why has <b>Thanksgiving</b> been observed in <b>Canada</b>? The first national <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> was celebrated in the Province of <b>Canada</b> in 1859. It was organized at the behest of leaders of the Protestant clergy, who appropriated the holiday of American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which was first observed in 1777 and established as a national day of ...  So in this blog post, I&rsquo;m going to talk about why <b>we</b> <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b>, what distinguishes Canadian and American Thanksgiving, and what the holiday has to do with how we remember and forget our collective histories.  In <b>Canada</b>, <b>we celebrate thanksgiving </b>in October. <b>We </b>see images of pilgrims feasting in America but is this also the history of Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b>?  TL;DR: This blog post explores the true history of Thanksgiving in Canada, revealing how European <b>colonizers</b> adopted <b>Indigenous</b> <b>traditions</b> while <b>perpetuating</b> <b>harm</b>. It traces the origins of Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>to</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>festivals</b>, emphasizing the <b>Haudenosaunee</b> <b>Confederacy</b>&#39;<b>s</b> <b>influence</b>.  Why Do We Celebrate? Canadian Thanksgiving is rooted in <b>Indigenous</b> <b>values</b>, including giving thanks for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. First Nations traditions would include feasting, prayer, dance and other ceremonies.  Since 1957, Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been celebrated on the second Monday of October. This change was made to separate the celebration of the harvest from the Remembrance Day commemorations of Canadian War veterans held in November. </p>        <p>Buy pre made thanksgiving dinner. <a href="./14.html">When was the first canadian thanksgiving</a>.
