        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving face painting for kids Teacherspayteachers sine and cosine thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  Thanksgiving is a national <b>holiday</b> celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a U.S. <b>holiday </b>celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  On October 3, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln declared that the last Thursday in November was to be recognized as a Day of Thanksgiving (Obama White House). In 1870, Congress passed legislation making Thanksgiving a <b>holiday</b>, but gave the president discretion to declare the date that the <b>holiday</b> would be celebrated.  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens <b>of</b> <b>Plymouth</b> Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>1621</b>.  In <b>1941</b>, a Congressional Joint Resolution officially set the fourth Thursday of November as a national holiday for Thanksgiving. Today, Thanksgiving is a time when many families come together, and many churches are open for special services.  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Macy&rsquo;s held its first Thanksgiving Day Parade just four years later. So these parades and games have been associated with the <b>holiday</b> for more than 100 years now. Parades have been a staple of the Thanksgiving <b>holiday</b> since 1920. The best known is the annual Macy&rsquo;s Day Parade in New York City, which began in 1924.  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as <b>Spanish</b> and English days of feasting and prayer to become the football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today.
