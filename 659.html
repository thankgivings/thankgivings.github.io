        <h2><strong>White peoplpe thanksgiving food Why not to eat a turkey on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> is basically a Filipino gathering ... with a turkey. Three or four families gather in one space &mdash; uncles getting drunk, Titas and aunties talking &mdash; to eat never-ending <b>food</b>.  As a white family in Louisiana we ate lots of good Thanksgiving <b>food</b>, a whole variety of all kinds traditional and Cajun/ Creole stuff. They also weren&rsquo;t afraid of seasoning or variety. In North Carolina it&rsquo;s almost always the typical Thanksgiving fair you&rsquo;d expect.  We ate white people <b>food</b>. No masala turkey, no fusion dressing, no side of cilantro chutney. Just straight-up Thanksgiving. We called (and still call) ourselves the Arkansas Group, named after weekend trips to Arkansas state parks, just across the Mississippi River from Memphis.  The simple reason suburban (and therefore, &ldquo;<b>bland</b>&rdquo;) food became synonymous with whiteness is because it was mostly white people who lived in the suburbs. However, the generalization that this produced &ldquo;white food&rdquo; or was in keeping with traditionally white cuisine is a complete misnomer.  From roasted turkey to pumpkin pie (and all the traditional sides that come in between), these tried-and-true recipes make a welcome addition to any <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal. <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a day to...  Serve these <b>Thanksgiving</b> side dishes to impress guests, satisfy holiday cravings, and create great leftovers.  This article delves into the world of white <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>foods</b>, exploring how they not only complement the traditional fare but also stand out with their distinct, comforting flavors and serene presentation.  The classic <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner includes old-time favorites that never change: turkey, gravy, stuffing, potatoes, veggies, and pie. But the way these dishes are made or added to is everchanging because of food trends and different dietary requirements.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> traditions vary from culture to culture, all across the country. But the very specific differences between Thanksgiving in households of Black People versus the households of White People are hilariously stark.
