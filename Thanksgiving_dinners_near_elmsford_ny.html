        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving dinners near elmsford ny Education com thanksgiving crossword puzzle answers</strong></h2>
        <p>The geographical landscape of <b>Plymouth</b> (or Plimoth Plantation as the settlers called it in 1621), was a direct link to the foods that were eaten at the first Thanksgiving. Plymouth&#39;s coastal location overlooking Cape Cod Bay offered a multitude of shellfish to those who inhabited the area.  From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was eaten <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  <b>What Did</b> the Pilgrims <b>Eat</b> on the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Many dishes served during modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> meals were not present <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have potatoes, nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> have butter or flour necessary for making pies.  When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the Pilgrims <b>did</b> <b>eat</b> turkey <b>in 1621</b>, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  The meal consisted of deer, corn, <b>shellfish</b>, and roasted <b>meat</b>, different from today&#39;s traditional Thanksgiving feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were...  Traditional Thanksgiving dinner includes turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes but the First Thanksgiving likely included wildfowl, <b>corn</b>, porridge and venison. Bettmann / Corbis  The Wampanoag and English settlers may not have had access to all of the ingredients included in these recipes, but by including <b>pheasant</b>, <b>goose</b>, <b>or</b> <b>venison</b> in your Thanksgiving menu, you&rsquo;re at least paying tribute to a meat they likely enjoyed back in 1621.  So, to the question &ldquo;What did the Pilgrims eat for Thanksgiving,&rdquo; the answer is both surprising and <b>expected</b>. <b>Turkey</b> (<b>probably</b>), <b>venison</b>, <b>seafood</b>, and all of the vegetables that they had planted and harvested that <b>year</b>&mdash;<b>onions</b>, <b>carrots</b>, <b>beans</b>, <b>spinach</b>, <b>lettuce</b>, and other <b>greens</b>.  BU Today: What do we know about the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> and what might have been included on the menu? Metheny: The &ldquo;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; which took place in the fall of <b>1621</b> at the site of Patuxet (present-day Plymouth, Mass.), was reflective of several English traditions: a harvest festival, typically held in the autumn after the harvest was successfully brought in, as well as a religious ... </p>        <p>Top 10 thanksgiving recipes food network. <a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/792.html">Macys thanksgiving balloons</a>.
