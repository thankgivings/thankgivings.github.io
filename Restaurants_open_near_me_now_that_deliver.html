        <h2><strong>Restaurants open near me now that deliver Cooking my first thanksgiving dinner</strong></h2>
        <p>Eating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> allows more time between the main meal and dessert, which means you can truly savor and enjoy every bite of pie or whatever other baked good you&rsquo;re eating (without feeling way too full to take another bite).  **Most people eat Thanksgiving dinner in the late afternoon or early evening, typically <b>around</b> <b>2:00</b> <b>p</b>.<b>m</b>. to 6:00 p.m.** This traditional timeframe allows for ample preparation and ensures that the whole family can enjoy the meal together.  Americans don&rsquo;t agree on what <b>time</b> to eat. Although nearly all Americans agree that <b>Thanksgiving</b> is worth celebrating, there&rsquo;s no consensus on the right <b>time</b> to eat. Pew found that 36% of U.S. adults would prefer to have <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> between 12 and 3 p.m., while 38% want the food to be served between 3 and 6 p.m.  According to the experts, there <b>isn</b>&#39;<b>t</b> necessarily a right <b>time</b> to start digging in, but there&#39;s absolutely a wrong <b>time</b>.

A YouGov poll of 1,000 Americans found that the highest percentage of Americans eat <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> between 4 and 5 p.m. To avoid this issue, St-Onge recommends leaving a couple of hours at the end of the day for your body to digest everything before going to bed.  I&rsquo;m all for Thanksgiving dining earlier &ndash; it can be <b>2</b> <b>p</b>.<b>m</b>., 3 p.m. or even 5 p.m. in your home, but should certainly start earlier than your usual 7 or 8 p.m. dinner. Here are a few things to...  Dining at, <b>say</b>, <b>7</b> <b>p</b>.<b>m</b>., while standard on a regular night, precludes one from experiencing the vital activities that follow a feast: a genuine nap and ample time to digest before reheating... </p>        <p><a href="./803.html">Season of love thanksgiving prayer debbie macomber</a>.
