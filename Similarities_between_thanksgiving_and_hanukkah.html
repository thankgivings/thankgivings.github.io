        <h2><strong>Similarities between thanksgiving and hanukkah Cheesy thanksgiving sweater</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving as a national holiday owes its origins <b>to</b> Sarah <b>Josepha</b> <b>Hale</b>, who lobbied Abraham Lincoln&mdash;and wrote &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;  The <b>Mashpee</b> <b>Wampanoag</b> first encountered the Pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower ship in 1620. They say much is missing from the often-told Thanksgiving story.  That&#39;s why many Native Americans and others mark <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a solemn day of remembrance instead of celebration. Here&#39;s what really went down after the plates were cleared in Plymouth, Mass.  Today, as millions of American families gather together in celebration of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, many remain unaware of the real history <b>behind </b>the holiday. While in school, most children are taught that...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is popularly modeled on a romanticized view of the Pilgrims of Plimouth Colony in Massachusetts in the 1620s. The story tends to go that they held a feast to thank both the Native Americans who had helped them survive through the winter and God whom they believed had led them to the New World.&hellip;  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a <b>national</b> holiday celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  Today, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a time when many families come together, and many churches are open for special services. We have both Native Americans and immigrants to thank for the opportunity to observe a day of <b>thanksgiving</b>.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>What is open on thanksgiving in halifax.
