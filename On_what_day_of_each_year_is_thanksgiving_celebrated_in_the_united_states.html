        <h2><strong>On what day of each year is thanksgiving celebrated in the united states Thanksgiving history documents</strong></h2>
        <p>Mark your calendars: Thanksgiving is on November <b>28</b>, <b>2024</b>. Here&#39;s why the date changes every year, and why the holiday falls on the fourth Thursday in November!  The earlier date created an extra seven days for <b>Christmas</b> shopping since at that time retailers never began promoting the <b>Christmas</b> season until after <b>Thanksgiving</b>. But making the proclamation so close to the change wreaked havoc on the holiday schedules of many people, schools, and businesses, and most Americans were <b>not</b> in favor of the change.  Hint: It&#39;s not <b>because</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Thursday is <b>more</b> <b>alliterative</b> <b>than</b> Thanksgiving Friday. In 1789, President George Washington declared Thursday, Nov. 26, as a &quot;Day of Publick...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, November 28. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people...  With the new law, Thanksgiving could be no earlier <b>than</b> November 22 and no later than November 28. On December 26, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Congress&#39;s bill making the fourth Thursday of November officially Thanksgiving Day in the United States.  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday <b>of</b> November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Unlike other holidays, such as Dec. 25 for <b>Christmas</b> or Oct. 31 for Halloween, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was <b>not</b> always a consistent day.  The Reason Why <b>Thanksgiving Is </b>on the Fourth Thursday in <b>November </b>The date may change from year to year, but the day of the week will always be the same. Here&rsquo;s why.  In 2024, Thanksgiving will be observed on Thursday, November <b>28</b>. Thanksgiving has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year. The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is November 22; the latest is November 28. </p>        <p><i>On what day of each year is thanksgiving celebrated in the united states</i>.
