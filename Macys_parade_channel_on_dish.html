        <p>In the U.S., typical paid holidays include New Year&#39;s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, and Christmas Day, but these generally differ depending on the employer and job sector.  Because of its status, <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a guaranteed day <b>off</b> for many workers. The day after <b>Thanksgiving</b>, often referred to as Black <b>Friday</b>, is not a federal holiday. However, many employers grant this day <b>off</b> as well, especially in the private sector.  You likely know Thanksgiving and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day <b>are</b> paid federal holidays. Father&#39;s Day is not. Here are all the federal holidays.  Some places are closed the day after <b>Thanksgiving</b>. My husband&#39;s employers shut down for a half day Wednesday, all of Thursday and all of <b>Friday</b>. He will have work on Saturday again. His normal days <b>off</b> are Sunday and Monday. Many of the other employees normally have Saturday and Sunday <b>off</b> so they <b>get</b> a 4 day weekend.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is one of eleven federal holidays recognized nationwide by the United States Government. All non-essential federal government offices are closed on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, and all federal employees are paid even if they receive the day <b>off</b>.  During non-holiday periods, if your normal pay day is a <b>Friday</b>, payroll payments by direct deposit are available in workers&#39; accounts by 9 a.m. local time that <b>Friday</b> in &quot;virtually all cases.&quot;  Celebrated on the Friday after the fourth Thursday in November in the United States, The Day after Thanksgiving is <b>not</b> a federal holiday but is a holiday in almost half the states in the U.S. and is given as a day off by most employers.  The following holidays are observed by the majority of US businesses with paid time <b>off</b>: New Year&#39;s Day, New Year&#39;s Eve, [2] Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, <b>Thanksgiving</b>, the day after known as Black <b>Friday</b>, Christmas Eve and Christmas. There are also numerous holidays on the state and local level that are observed to varying degrees.  Do you need to give your employees vacation time for federal holidays? Well, it depends. If you&rsquo;re a federal employer, then <b>yes</b>, employees are entitled to these federal holidays (or replacement days) off. </p>        <p>I hop in flint thanksgiving hours.
