        <h2><strong>Prayers of thanksgiving for friends and mentors Macy day parade lip synced</strong></h2>
        <p>Chuseok is also known as Hangawi, which means the 15th <b>day</b> of August, according to the lunar calendar. On this <b>day</b>, a full harvest moon appeared in the sky and families gathered to enjoy time together and give thanks to <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> for the plentiful harvest.  People travel back to their ancestral homes and pay tribute to their ancestors for a good harvest. On this <b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> or <b>Korean</b> mid-autumn festival, rituals and rites are performed to pay respect to their ancestors and hope that their spirits will look after the coming generations.  Falling on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar <b>calendar</b>, Chuseok is often referred to as the Korean Thanksgiving Day. Chuseok is a time to give thanks for the bountiful harvest and pay respects to their ancestors.  Chuseok, falling on September 17th in 2024 and October 6th in 2025, sees its date shift annually. Deeply embedded in <b>Korean</b> culture, it is a time when families travel great distances to to celebrate the occasion. They also honor <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> through grave visits and the charye, an elaborate ceremony that honors those who have passed.  Chuseok is commonly incorrectly translated as &quot;<b>Korean Thanksgiving</b>&quot; in American English despite the holidays being vastly different in origin and celebration. [8][9] Although most South Koreans visit <b>their </b>families and ancestral homes, there are festivities held at the National Folk Museum of Korea.  Often referred to as &ldquo;<b>korean Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo;, Chuseok holds a special place in the hearts of Koreans as it represents a time for gratitude, family reunions, and honoring <b>ancestors</b>. In this blog post, we will explore the meaning, history, and customs associated with this cherished holiday.  In the days leading up to Chuseok, <b>Korean</b> families visit the graves of <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b>, a ritual called seongmyo (성묘), in order to pay <b>their</b> respects and perform beolcho (벌초), or cleaning the weeds and the overgrown grass around the gravesite.  Chuseok occurs on the 15th <b>day </b>of the 8th Lunar month during autumn. Chuseok offers an opportunity to express thanks and reflect on past experiences. The <b>Korean </b>people express <b>their </b>gratitude to <b>their ancestors </b>for the bountiful harvest they have received and pay <b>their </b>respects to the deceased.  <b>Chusok</b>, Korea&rsquo;s annual thanksgiving holiday, is one of the biggest migration events in modern Korea. Over half of the population visits families and ancestral graves during the three-day holiday, which usually falls sometime in September or October. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving text message greetings.
