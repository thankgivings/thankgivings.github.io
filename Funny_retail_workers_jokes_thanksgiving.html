It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  Thanksgiving is a <b>Protestant</b> tradition that predates the colonization of North America, but it has evolved into an often-secular holiday that carries with it the legacy of colonialism and the narratives surrounding America&rsquo;s origins.
