        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving game ideas for family Detrot lion cheerleaders thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>This prayer takes its inspiration from the verse in Psalm 24, &ldquo;<b>The</b> <b>earth</b> <b>is</b> <b>God</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b>.&rdquo; We begin by acknowledging that this land belongs to no one. We then honor the ancestral Native peoples who cared for this land, followed by our own immigrant ancestors who endured hardship to come here.  Our Writing Team invites you to celebrate your <b>Thanksgiving</b> immersed in reading selected <b>prayers</b> and poems from <b>American</b> <b>Indigenous</b> People&#39;s perspectives about <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  <b>Prayers</b> inspired by those who practice Native <b>American</b> spirituality and its traditions.  We are all thankful to our Mother, the Earth, for she gives us all that we need for life. She supports our feet as we walk about upon her. It gives us joy that she continues to care for us as she has from the beginning <b>of </b>time. To our mother, we send greetings and thanks. Now our minds are one.  This ancient prayer of Thanksgiving comes from <b>the</b> <b>Haudenosaunee</b> (Iroquois) people. The prayer is used to give thanks, bless gatherings, and greet the day. I plan to read it at a Thanksgiving gathering this year and hope it touches your heart as much as it touches mine.  <b>The</b> Thanksgiving Address (the Ohen:ton Karihwatehkwen) is the central prayer and invocation for the Haudenosaunee (also known as the Iroquois Confederacy or Six Nations &mdash; Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora). It reflects their relationship of giving thanks for life and the world around them.  How do Native <b>Americans</b> make peace with a national holiday that romanticizes the 1621 encounter between their ancestors and English settlers, and erases the deadly conflicts that followed?  These are the opening words of <b>the</b> <b>Ohenten</b> <b>Kariwatekwen</b>, also known as the Thanksgiving Address, a traditional prayer or greeting recited in Akwesasne. Often meetings start and end with the greeting as a way to get everyone in a good mind to work together for the best for all.  The <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>prayer</b> is a heartfelt tradition that honors Native American heritage and promotes gratitude. By embracing this ceremonial practice, we can deepen our connection to nature and foster a sense of appreciation for life&#39;s blessings. </p>        <p>Home depot hours during thanksgiving.
