        <p>Thanksgiving <b>Basket</b> pickup is located at the Goodman Community Center at 149 Waubesa St. in Madison. Expect to wait for 15-30 minutes to receive your basket. Basket pickup is a drive-thru system. The basket will be brought to your vehicle. If arriving on foot, please stay along the sidewalks and go to the check-in station upon arrival.  Let&#39;s talk turkey... and gravy, veggies, butter and rolls! For the past 36 years, our Thanksgiving <b>Basket</b> Drive has been a tradition, with many long-serving staff, volunteers and their children returning year after year. It takes a village, that&rsquo;s for certain.  The <b>Goodman</b> Community Center has announced the start of its 36th annual Thanksgiving <b>Basket</b> <b>Drive</b>, which provides the fixings for families to make full Thanksgiving meals at home, and Goodman is appealing to the public to help collect the food and money needed to fill all 4,000 planned baskets.  Donate to our Thanksgiving <b>Basket</b> Drive while you shop! Purchase items from our grocery list during your regular shopping and leave them in a marked cart near the entrance, or leave your frozen turkey with your cashier. Hy-Vee will deliver them to us in time for Thanksgiving. When: Saturday, Nov. 11, 10am - 2pm; Sunday, Nov. 12, 10am - 2pm  <b>MADISON</b> (WKOW) &ndash; The Goodman Community Center&#39;s annual Thanksgiving <b>Basket</b> Drive has hit a significant milestone this year, reaching its registration capacity just one day after opening. This marks the fastest the center has filled its list since the drive began 36 years ago. </p>        <p><a href="./548.html">There are no thursday thanksgiving classes</a>.
