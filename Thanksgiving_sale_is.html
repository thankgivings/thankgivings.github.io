        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving sale is Raiders thanksgiving hat</strong></h2>
        <p>Since 1957, <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day has been celebrated <b>in Canada</b> on the second Monday in October. How is <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrated? In both <b>Canada</b> and America, family and friends gather for a meal and other celebrations on <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is rooted in Indigenous values, including giving thanks for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. First Nations traditions would include feasting, prayer, dance and other ceremonies. However, the concept of <b>thanksgiving</b> was influenced by our American neighbours.  As in the United States, <b>Canada</b> observed occasional Thanksgivings to celebrate important events such as the end of the War of 1812. And like its neighbor, <b>Canada</b>&rsquo;s first thanksgivings tended to...  Believe it or not, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in Canada</b>, or at least the land that would become <b>Canada</b>, has its own history, separate from our American counterparts. Traditions of giving thanks long predate the arrival of European settlers in North America.  What&#39;s the difference between <b>Thanksgiving</b> in America and <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b>? In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November but in Canada, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.).  That&rsquo;s because in Canada, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> in <b>October</b>. Unlike Americans, whose holiday recalls the Pilgrims landing in America, Canadians spend their Thanksgiving giving thanks for a successful harvest, which typically culminates by early October in the northern country of Canada.  It may be surprising to hear that Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is actually older than its southern counterpart&#39;s celebration. There are also some differences between how the holidays are celebrated across borders. Here&#39;s why Canadians celebrate, and how they get together to make the holiday happen. Why do Canadians celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>?  Since 1957, Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been celebrated on the second Monday of October. This change was made to separate the celebration of the harvest from the Remembrance Day commemorations of Canadian War veterans held in November.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions . </p>        <p>Religious thanksgiving text messages. <a href="./143.html">Photo cards for thanksgiving</a>.
