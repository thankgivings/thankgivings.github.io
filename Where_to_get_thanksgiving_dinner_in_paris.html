        <h2><strong>Where to get thanksgiving dinner in paris Thanksgiving scramble words printable</strong></h2>
        <p>In Canada, <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is <b>celebrated</b> on the second Monday in October (since 1957). Why do we eat turkey on <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Although it is often assumed that today&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> menu originated in an event commonly referred to as the &ldquo;<b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&quot; there is no indication that turkey was served at the meal shared between Pilgrim ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a U.S. holiday <b>celebrated</b> each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  From the earliest fall feasts to the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> football game to the Macy&#39;s Day parade, here&#39;s the full background on how the U.S. holiday evolved to the tradition it is today.  President Zachary Taylor said around 1849 that it was up to the states to decide when and whether to declare a <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday; in that period, such a holiday was often <b>celebrated</b> anywhere ...  Plymouth Colony &amp; <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  Festivals of <b>Thanksgiving</b> were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years. They tended to be autumn harvest celebrations. But in 1789, Elias Boudinot, Massachusetts, member of the House of Representatives, moved that a day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> be held to thank God for giving the American people the opportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their hard won freedoms.  The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623.  Shrine of the <b>first</b> U.S. <b>Thanksgiving</b> held at Berkeley Hundred in Charles City County, Virginia in 1619. Devotees in New England, Virginia and other places have maintained contradictory claims to having held the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>celebration</b> in what became the United States. The question is complicated by the concept of <b>Thanksgiving</b> as either ... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving cookies nytimes. Thanksgiving worksheets for 4th grade free.
