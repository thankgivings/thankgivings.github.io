        <p><b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Find out when Thanksgiving <b>became</b> a national holiday, why it&#39;s on a Thursday and any other Thanksgiving questions.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as Spanish and English days of feasting and prayer to become the football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today. English...  Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest <b>feast</b> shared by the English colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  The history of Thanksgiving has been muddled, debunked, and rewritten throughout history, but here&rsquo;s why <b>we</b> carve a <b>turkey</b> <b>and</b> <b>mash</b> some <b>potatoes</b> each year.  National <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day observances are largely filled with myths and misinformation. Popular American folklore suggests the &ldquo;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; was an idyllic <b>feast</b>. This myth, which ignores the fact that the <b>feast</b> was never repeated and that <b>Thanksgiving</b> is an invented holiday, runs contrary to many realities.  By federal law, Americans <b>have</b> celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the fourth Thursday in November since 1942, but numerous other dates were designated in the past. It is believed that America&rsquo;s first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, actually a harvest <b>feast</b> that brought together 53 Pilgrims and some 90 Native Americans, occurred in the fall of 1621. Beginning in 1668 ...  Most Americans are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Feast</b> of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North America. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day, observed in 2024 <b>on </b>Thursday, November 28, honors <b>a </b>1621 <b>feast </b>between the Plymouth colonists from England and the Wampanoag people. &ldquo;The reason that <b>we have </b>so many myths... </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/527.html">Thanksgiving coloring pages for childrens church</a>.
