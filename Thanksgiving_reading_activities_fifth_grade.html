        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving reading activities fifth grade Recipe sweet potato quick bread</strong></h2>
        <p>In Canada, starting in <b>1921</b>, Thanksgiving and Armistice Day were observed on the same day in November. To better honor veterans, Armistice Day was renamed Remembrance Day in 1931 and set as November 11 each year. Thanksgiving, meanwhile, did not become an official holiday in Canada until 1957.  It has become common knowledge that the first Thanksgiving in North America was held by <b>Sir</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> and his crew in Nunavut in 1578. There are those &mdash; mainly Americans upset by the thought of having their holiday co-opted &mdash; who argue that it wasn&#39;t a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Thanksgiving.  The first large, national Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated in <b>1859</b> in what was then called the province of Canada. The province of Canada was developed when Upper Canada and Lower Canada were united by Britain in 1841.  Canadian Thanksgiving kicked off with a feast of biscuits, salt beef, and mushy peas in 1578. That&rsquo;s when <b>Sir</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> sailed from England in search of the Northwest Passage.  Thanksgiving was first observed as an annual event in Canada <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>. The date for observance and the &lsquo;unifying theme&rsquo; (usually harvest related) was determined annually by our Parliament.  In Canada, Parliament established a national Thanksgiving Day in <b>1879</b>. Thanksgiving Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year.  On January 31, 1957, the Governor General of <b>Canada</b> Vincent Massey issued a proclamation stating: &quot;A <b>Day</b> of General <b>Thanksgiving</b> to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which <b>Canada</b> has been blessed &ndash; to be observed on the second Monday in October.&quot;  The first official, annual Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>, though Indigenous peoples in Canada have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  On <b>January</b> <b>31</b>, <b>1957</b>, the Canadian Parliament proclaimed: A Day of General Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed &ndash; to be observed on the 2nd Monday in October.
