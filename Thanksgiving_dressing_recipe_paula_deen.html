        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving dressing recipe paula deen Restaurant thanksgiving dinner toronto</strong></h2>
        <p>Taking my new found wisdom into account, my opinion of the &ldquo;best holiday of the year&rdquo; has changed from <b>Christmas</b> to Thanksgiving. My views, including favorite holiday, have changed because my focus on what&rsquo;s important has matured.  Some are recognized more than others but none two are as highly recognized like the cherished <b>Christmas</b> and Thanksgiving holidays. The pair may seem vastly different, as they are two completely separate occasions, but in actuality they do share very similar attributes.  Some are recognized more than others but none two are as highly recognized like the cherished <b>Christmas</b> and Thanksgiving holidays. The pair may seem vastly different, as they are two completely separate occasions, but in actuality they do share very similar attributes.  <b>Christmas</b> and Thanksgiving are the two most commonly celebrated holidays in North America. These two holidays are set apart by many differences. Traditions, purpose of the holidays, and the decorations are three points of contrast. Some of the differences exhibited in Christmas and Thanksgiving begin with the traditions they carry. The time ...  Thanksgiving is <b>for</b> <b>thanking</b> God for the gift of harvest and plenty, whereas, Christmas is to thank and commemorate Jesus coming as a baby. . Differences exhibited by Thanksgiving and <b>Christmas</b> begin with the decorations. Thanksgiving is adorned by fall colors.  Thanksgiving holiday is a day to come together as a family to give thanks to God for everything that one has obtained. <b>Christmas</b> is a holiday that revives families, love, and is a new beginning. Although they are both similar holidays in which families gather they also have differences.  In a question-and-answer column on the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association&rsquo;s website, a newcomer to the U.S. asked the evangelist which holiday is more important between Thanksgiving and <b>Christmas</b>. In response to the query, Rev. Graham explained the roots of the two holidays and why they are equally important.  Every year we host <b>Thanksgiving </b>dinner at our house. I love this time because I can spend time with my family which we tend to overlook. After all, our everyday lives are very busy. My household tends to stay in this state until after <b>Thanksgiving </b>when it is time to start getting ready for <b>Christmas</b>.  Thanksgiving and <b>Christmas</b> are both holidays when people show lots of concern and compassion for others. Even though there are many similarities between the two, they also have lots of differences. Traditions and the seasons are two main areas that differ when comparing and contrasting. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving cornucopia lord. Valerie bertinelli thanksgiving.
