        <h2><strong>How many years until thanksgiving and hanukkah fall on the same day Martha stewart thanksgiving placemat</strong></h2>
        <p>It was President Lincoln who declared <b>Thanksgiving</b> a national celebration in 1863. The <b>Plymouth</b> Pilgrims simply celebrated survival, as well as the hopes of good fortune in the years that lay ahead.  During the autumn of 1621, at least 90 Wampanoag joined 52 English people at what is now <b>Plymouth</b>, Massachusetts, to mark a successful harvest. It is remembered today as the &ldquo;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; although no one back then used that term. In fact, much of the so-called First <b>Thanksgiving</b> story was created decades and centuries later.  That first formal declaration was three years after their arrival, when practices and habits had begun to solidify. However, the very first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was in 1621, most likely in November, a year after their arrival.  For the full text of every presidential <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>proclamation</b>, click here. The Pilgrims&rsquo; first recorded religious day of thanksgiving was held in 1623. Plymouth had been stricken with a severe drought.  Governor Bradford of Massachusetts made this first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Proclamation</b> three years after the Pilgrims settled at <b>Plymouth</b>:  Now I, your magistrate, do proclaim that all ye Pilgrims, with your wives and ye little ones, do gather at ye meeting house, on ye hill, between the hours of 9 and 12 in the day time, on Thursday, November 29th, of the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred and twenty-three and the third year since ye Pilgrims landed on ye Pilgrim Rock ...  The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  Abraham Lincoln issued <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Proclamations</b> in the spring of 1862 and the spring of 1863; both <b>proclamations</b> gave thanks for victories in battle.  The Pilgrims subsequently founded <b>Plymouth</b> Colony and formed an alliance with the Wampanoag. ... It wasn&#39;t until 1863 that President Abraham Lincoln made his <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Proclamation</b>, ... </p>        <p><strong>How many years until thanksgiving and hanukkah fall on the same day</strong>.
