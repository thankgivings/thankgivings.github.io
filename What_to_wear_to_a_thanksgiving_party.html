        <p>The first large, national Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>in</b> <b>1859</b> in what was then called the province of Canada. The province of Canada was developed when Upper Canada and Lower Canada were united by Britain in 1841.  The first Thanksgiving after Confederation was observed <b>on</b> <b>5</b> <b>April</b> <b>1872</b>, a national civic holiday rather than a religious one. Thanksgiving was first observed as an annual event in Canada on 6 November 1879.  <b>Canada</b> was the first country in North America to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>. In fact, the Indigenous Peoples of <b>Canada</b> have been having annual fall harvest <b>thanksgiving</b> celebrations for hundreds of years prior to the arrival of European settlers.  English <b>explorer</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> hosted the first Canadian Thanksgiving. It was held in what is now Newfoundland during his expedition&#39;s attempts to find the Northwest Passage to the Orient in 1578 and marked their safe arrival to the New World.  It has become common knowledge that the first Thanksgiving in North America was held <b>by</b> <b>Sir</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> and his crew in Nunavut in 1578. There are those &mdash; mainly Americans upset by the thought of having their holiday co-opted &mdash; who argue that it wasn&#39;t a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Thanksgiving.  Canadian Thanksgiving kicked off with a feast of biscuits, salt beef, and mushy peas <b>in</b> <b>1578</b>. That&rsquo;s when Sir Martin Frobisher sailed from England in search of the Northwest Passage.  The first Thanksgiving Day after Confederation was observed as a civic holiday on <b>April</b> <b>5</b>, <b>1872</b>, to celebrate the recovery of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) from a serious illness. [ 27 ]  The first official, annual Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>, though Indigenous peoples in Canada have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  Some historians argue that the first Thanksgiving in North America took place in Canada <b>in</b> <b>1578</b>, following Martin Frobisher&rsquo;s safe arrival in Newfoundland after a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage. Even earlier, Indigenous Peoples had their own traditions for honoring the Earth&rsquo;s abundance during the fall season. </p>        <p>Walmart thanksgiving sale 2024 ipad.
