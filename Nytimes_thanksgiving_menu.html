        <p>But before we all descend into food comas, it&#39;s important to reflect on the real <b>history</b> of Thanksgiving &mdash; and the first one wasn&#39;t all peace, love and pass the gravy. While the settlers at ...  The Thanksgiving story deeply rooted in America&rsquo;s school curriculum frames the Pilgrims as the main characters and reduces the Wampanoag Indians to supporting roles. It also erases a monumentally <b>sad</b> <b>history</b>. The true <b>history</b> of Thanksgiving begins with the Indians.  Editor&#39;s Note: This story first published in 2020. The traditional story of Thanksgiving, and by extension the Pilgrims &mdash; the one repeated in school <b>history</b> books and given the Peanuts treatment ...  Although many Potawatomi and others across the United States celebrate Thanksgiving, the factual <b>history</b> behind the holiday is something to be less than thankful for. While communing with loved ones and showing appreciation for the bounties and gifts provided is one positive aspect of the national holiday, teaching a false narrative of its beginnings perpetuates colonialism and ignores more ...  But, as David Silverman writes in his new book This Land Is Their Land: The Wampanoag Indians, Plymouth Colony, and the Troubled <b>History</b> of Thanksgiving, much of that story is a myth riddled with ...  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is typically marketed as a wholesome family holiday. The true origins of <b>Thanksgiving </b>whitewash the holiday&#39;s gruesome and unjust past, erasing the true narrative of Native Americans. The turkey industry, which kills 46 million turkeys for every <b>Thanksgiving</b>, has become another brutal aspect of the controversial holiday.  There are always two sides to a story. Unfortunately, when it comes to the <b>history</b> of Thanksgiving, generations of Americans have been taught a one-sided <b>history</b> in their homes and schools. The dominant cultural and historical story has been told from the perspective of the European colonialists who landed near Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts in ...  Plymouth Colony &amp; First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia.  Yet others believe Thanksgiving truly began when, in 1637, Massachusetts colony governor John Winthrop declared a day to give thanks for the fact that colonial soldiers had recently slaughtered over seven hundred members of the Pequot tribe, including women and children, in Connecticut.
