        <h2><strong>Top places to visit in april 2024 Thanksgiving short stories for high school</strong></h2>
        <p>Veterans Day and <b>Thanksgiving</b> are both popular across <b>Walt</b> <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b>, which means to expect heavy crowds if visiting then. Christmas events usually kick off at Magic Kingdom, look for Mickey&rsquo;s Very Merry Christmas Party to start this month. Food and Wine Festival at Epcot wraps up this month.  If you are trying to find out when the busiest time to visit Disney is, then our <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b> Crowd Calendars for 2024 and 2025 will help you avoid crowds and long waits in line. There is no real &ldquo;off-season&rdquo; in Disney World, but you definitely can find plenty of days when the crowd levels are low.  As of January 9, 2024, theme park reservations are no longer required for date-based tickets at <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b>. While theme park reservations are no longer required for date-based tickets, they still are required for some admission types like Annual Passes.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (November 22-29, 2024; November 21-28, 2025) &ndash; Just about any <b>Walt</b> <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b> fan is familiar with the crowds of the final three <b>weeks</b> on this list. They&rsquo;re hardly a secret or surprise, and are predictably <b>busy</b> year in and year out.  Summer break is consistently a popular time <b>at Walt</b> <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b> with many schools out for summer break but these crowds are often not nearly as intense as you may see during holiday <b>weeks</b>, like <b>Thanksgiving</b> and Christmas, along with some three day holiday weekends.  Choosing the best days of the <b>week</b>&ndash;and avoiding the worst ones&ndash;at each <b>Walt</b> <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b> theme park comes <b>after</b> all of those things. To be sure, it&rsquo;s a good practice and worth keeping in mind that Magic Kingdom is best on Thursday or Friday, or that EPCOT should be avoided on weekends.  The first <b>week</b> or so of February before school breaks, the first <b>week</b> of December in between <b>Thanksgiving</b> and the holidays, and weekdays during the fall will all be less <b>crowded</b> valleys between the peaks of the holidays.  To everyone else, enjoy a lovely non-holiday <b>week</b>. Here in the United States, fans are flocking to the theme parks as the holiday approaches. However, the <b>week</b> before <b>Thanksgiving</b> isn&rsquo;t generally that <b>busy</b>, at least not historically. How were the crowds this past <b>week</b>? Here are <b>Walt</b> <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b>&rsquo;s wait times for the third <b>week</b> of November 2024.  This crowd report shares recent wait time data, the degree to which there was a post-holiday hangover, and thoughts on what&rsquo;s likely to happen next with attendance this <b>week</b> and in early December 2021 <b>at Walt</b> <b>Disney</b> <b>World</b>. <b>Thanksgiving</b> being an insanely <b>busy</b> <b>week</b> should be unsurprising. </p>        <p>What stores have black friday sales on thanksgiving.
