        <h2><strong>End of the year thanksgiving sermons Thanksgiving baby announcement shirt</strong></h2>
        <p>What is the date of the First Thanksgiving? The First Thanksgiving is dated <b>to</b> <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday? Thanksgiving became an American holiday in 1863 but was not observed in every state until after 1963. Why do Native Americans object to Thanksgiving?  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the <b>1621</b> harvest gathering, the first recorded religious Thanksgiving Day in Plymouth happened two years later in <b>1623</b>. On this occasion,...  The first Thanksgiving service known to be held by Europeans in North America occurred <b>on</b> <b>May</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1578</b>, in Newfoundland, although earlier Church-type services were probably held by Spaniards in La Florida.  In <b>Fall</b> <b>1621</b>, the Pilgrims held a public day of Thanksgiving to God for His provision and blessings, celebrating their harvest with a feast.  Several days of Thanksgiving were held in early <b>New</b> <b>England</b> history that have been identified as the &quot;First Thanksgiving&quot;, including Pilgrim holidays in Plymouth in 1621 and 1623, and a Puritan holiday in Boston in 1631.  When was the <b>first Thanksgiving</b>? The story behind <b>Thanksgiving</b> starts in 1620 when a group of Protestants, who had left their native England after they were persecuted for their religion there, landed in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  When Americans rediscovered Winslow&#39;s account in <b>1822</b>, the unremarkable harvest feast of <b>1621</b> was elevated to become the &ldquo;First Thanksgiving.&rdquo; 6 By that time, American Thanksgiving practices had come to resemble that earlier feast.  It wasn&rsquo;t <b>until</b> <b>1863</b>, in the midst of the Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national Thanksgiving Day to be held each November. But the holiday is not without controversy...  According to the Texas Society Daughters of the American Colonists, the very first thanksgiving was observed by Spanish <b>explorer</b> Francisco Vasquez de <b>Coronado</b>. Accompanied by 1,500 men in full... </p>        <p><strong>End of the year thanksgiving sermons</strong>. New movies for thanksgiving weekend. Thanksgiving break.
