        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving recipes rice Whats open on thanksgiving monday hamilton</strong></h2>
        <p>Two primary sources&mdash;<b>the </b>only surviving documents that reference <b>the </b>meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of <b>the </b>harvest celebration shared by <b>the </b>Pilgrims and Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony in...  According to the Plimoth Plantation, a living history museum in Plymouth, Massachusetts, the <b>first Thanksgiving</b> wasn&rsquo;t even called the <b>first Thanksgiving</b> until the 1830s. And the holiday wasn&rsquo;t made official until 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln declared it as such.  Whether mashed or roasted, white or <b>sweet</b>, <b>potatoes</b> had no place at the first Thanksgiving. After encountering it in its native South America, the Spanish began introducing the potato to...  Here, in this article, I debunk a few of the most popular misconceptions about the so-called &ldquo;<b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; including when it was held, why it was held, and who was present at it. Misconception #1: The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner in North America was held by the Pilgrims in Massachusetts in 1621. This is completely false.  Editor&#39;s Note: This story <b>first</b> published in 2020. The traditional story of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, and by extension the Pilgrims &mdash; the one repeated in school history books and given the Peanuts treatment in &quot;A Charlie Brown <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; &mdash; doesn&rsquo;t start in 1620, with the cold and seasick Pilgrims stepping off the Mayflower onto Plymouth Rock.  Although the modern day Thanksgiving feast takes place on the fourth Thursday of November, the first Thanksgiving did not. This feast most likely happened sometime between September <b>and</b> November of <b>1621</b>.  From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>probably</b> <b>didn</b>&#39;<b>t</b> <b>include</b> a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  In 1846, Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of a magazine called Godey&rsquo;s Lady&rsquo;s Book, campaigned for an annual national <b>thanksgiving</b> holiday. But it wasn&#39;t until 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln...  BU Today: What do we know about the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> and what might have been <b>included</b> on the menu? Metheny: The <b>&ldquo;First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; which took place in the fall of 1621 at the site of Patuxet (present-day Plymouth, Mass.), was reflective of several English traditions: a harvest festival, typically held in the autumn after the harvest was successfully brought in, as well as a religious ... </p>        <p><a href="./610.html">Thanksgiving dinner to order</a>. <a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/817.html">Music suitable for thanksgiving</a>.
