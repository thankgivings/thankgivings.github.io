        <h2><strong>Happy thanksgiving images for the elders Small thanksgiving graphics</strong></h2>
        <p>Did you know that the first &ldquo;<b>thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; meal in the United States may not have been celebrated by the Pilgrims in Plymouth, but by Spanish settlers, in what became Florida? And that first...  In March 1621, the chief of the Wampanoag confederation, Massasoit, went to meet with the Pilgrims and brought Tisquantum along to translate. After negotiations fell apart, Tisquantum stayed with...  The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was held about half a century earlier and more than a thousand miles to the south. And it was held by <b>Catholic</b> explorers. There are actually several claimants to the first <b>Catholic</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  Thanksgiving&rsquo;s universal appeal is due in part to its deep Catholic roots. The origin story of Thanksgiving that we usually tell is that of the <b>Pilgrims</b>, the group of settlers that arrived in 1620 in what is now Massachusetts.  The Catholics beat the Pilgrims to the New World, Catholics should commemorate the 1565 Mass in Florida as the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> in America instead of the 1621 Pilgrim feast with the Indians...  It American mythology, the celebration of Thanksgiving traces its roots back to the pioneering <b>Puritan</b> <b>pilgrims</b> of <b>Plymouth</b> <b>Rock</b> who gathered to give thanks for a good harvest in their new North American home.  Julie Larsen discusses early celebrations of Thanksgiving among Catholics in the United States. I think the <b>Mass</b> is the highest form of Thanksgiving for Catholics. So, I decided to research about where the first Mass in America was celebrated.  Americans typically look back to 1621 as the first recorded <b>Thanksgiving</b>, where the Plymouth colonists and Wampanoag Indians gathered for a three-day feast of <b>Thanksgiving</b> to God for the harvest. A detailed description of the First <b>Thanksgiving</b> can be found in &quot;A Journal of the Pilgrims at Plymouth,&quot; written by Edward Winslow in 1621:  The first Thanksgiving feast was celebrated back in <b>1598</b>, in New Mexico, by Spanish-Catholic colonists and Indian converts to the Faith. They thanked the true God for bringing them safely through many troubles and dangers and for the fact that the seed of the Gospel of Christ was beginning to take root. </p>        <p>Games fall 2024 thanksgiving. <i>Happy thanksgiving images for the elders</i>.
