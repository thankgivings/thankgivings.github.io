May their influence continue to shape our lives, and may we find solace in the hope of reunion in Your eternal presence. Revelation 21:4  Help us to remember that although we are separated for a time, we will all rejoice <b>one</b> day when we stand together in Your presence. Thank You that the brief night of weeping will pass very quickly, and we will all be rejoicing in Your presence on that glorious morning when we will all be reunited in the hope that is set before us.
