        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving and history channel Easy thanksgiving dinner menu</strong></h2>
        <p>In <b>Japan</b>, a coun&shy;try where Chris&shy;tians con&shy;sti&shy;tute just one or two per&shy;cent of the pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion, eat&shy;ing <b>KFC</b> has become one of Christ&shy;mas&rsquo; pri&shy;ma&shy;ry cul&shy;tur&shy;al asso&shy;ci&shy;a&shy;tions.  Fried chicken and Christmas have become synonymous: <b>KFC</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> advertisements feature major pop cultural figures chomping on drumsticks, the company website even has a countdown until Christmas.  Yes, you read that correctly: Christmas and <b>KFC</b> are completely intertwined in <b>Japan</b>. Around December 25, families gather around the table to eat a bucket of fried chicken for the occasion &ndash;...  Lines outside the restaurants start on Dec. 23, with Christmas Eve being <b>KFC</b> <b>Japan</b>&#39;<b>s</b> busiest day when the chain usually sells about five to 10 times more than typical days.  A team member on the <b>KFC</b> <b>Japan</b> sales team overheard the remark and used it as inspiration to launch the first Christmas campaign and its tagline- Kentucky for Christmas. The campaign was a hit, and Kentucky for Christmas quickly became a tradition across Japan that lives on to this day.  Ever wondered why <b>KFC</b> is a Christmas staple in <b>Japan</b>? This unique tradition, blending Western holiday cheer with Japanese customs, sees families flocking to KFC for their festive feast. Discover how a clever marketing campaign transformed fried chicken into a beloved holiday tradition across Japan. Why Is KFC A Christmas Tradition In Japan?  In 1560, thanks to the missionary work of Francis Xavier, the first recorded Christmas event was held in Kyoto, attended by about 100 people. In 1568, as incredible as it sounds, there is an account of the warlords Oda Nobunaga and Matsunaga Hisahide agreeing to a temporary truce over Christmas.  Published: October 27, 2022 - Last updated: February 28, 2024. Here&rsquo;s a look at the <b>KFC</b> <b>Japan</b> menu in English and some of the more unique items being offered at <b>KFC</b> <b>Japan</b>. Did you know that people in Japan eat fried chicken for Christmas dinner?  In what is a uniquely <b>Japanese</b> Christmas, millions would never let the season go by without having Kentucky Fried Chicken (<b>KFC</b>) on the dinner table. For a country where less than 2% of the population is Christian, this is the best way to join the world&#39;s festivities. </p>        <p>Happy thanksgiving day wiki.
