        <h2><strong>When was macy first thanksgiving parade Country stars thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>NEW YORK CITY, N.Y. &mdash; The <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>Parade</b>, an iconic American tradition, made its debut on November 27, 1924. Originally called the <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s Christmas <b>Parade</b>, the event was ...  On Nov. 27, 1924 at 9 a.m., the <b>first</b> <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s <b>parade</b> started its way down a 6-mile route through the main streets of New York City. Since then, the <b>parade</b> route has been trimmed to 2.5 miles and the <b>parade</b> has grown, becoming one of the most beloved American traditions and bringing millions of people together every <b>Thanksgiving</b> morning.  The first Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, <b>held</b> <b>November</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1924</b>, was called &ldquo;Macy&rsquo;s Christmas Parade&rdquo; and aimed at ginning up demand for Christmas shopping.  At 9 a.m. on the sunlit morning <b>of</b> <b>November</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1924</b>, Macy&rsquo;s gave the children of New York a particularly special Thanksgiving treat as a police escort led the start of the parade from the...  The <b>parade</b> proved a big success, and a new annual tradition was born. Santa Claus appeared in the <b>first</b> <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Parade</b> in 1924. Daily News: November 28, 1924. In 1927, organizers rebranded the <b>parade</b> as the <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>Parade</b> and took the event to a new level.  When was the first televised Thanksgiving Parade? <b>In</b> <b>1948</b>, The Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Day Parade was nationally broadcasted for the first time on CBS. That was over 20 years after its inception, though it makes sense when you realize cable wasn&#39;t even invented until earlier that year.  On <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1924, a <b>parade</b> set out from 145th Street in New York, and proceeded down the Upper West Side, all the way from Harlem to Midtown. This was the <b>first</b>-ever <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>Parade</b>. The New York Times of November 28 described the event: &ldquo;Santa Claus chose <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day this year to come to town.&rdquo;  Originally known as the Macy&rsquo;s Christmas Parade, Thanksgiving Day, <b>November</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1924</b> was the beginning of an annual tradition. In an effort to boost holiday sales and highlight Macy&rsquo;s new store, employees organized the parade and animals from the Central Park Zoo were featured. 1  The very <b>first</b> <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>Parade</b> took place in 1924, when store employees marched to <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s Herald Square, dressed in costumes. It was not really covered by the media. </p>        <p>Is lubys open on thanksgiving day. Dia de acao de gracas e thanksgiving day. Bob evans thanksgiving dinner to go. Happy thanksgiving art design.
