        <h2><strong>What restraunts in las vegas are serving thanksgiving dinner Thanksgiving football rivalries high school</strong></h2>
        <p>Want to learn some <b>Thanksgiving</b>-inspired <b>Norwegian </b>vocab to share around the table? These <b>Thanksgiving</b>-related terms have been translated from English to <b>Norwegian </b>by Ethan Bjelland. Feast &ndash; festm&aring;ltid (a festive meal); bankett (banquet) Potato &ndash; Potet. Tradition &ndash; tradisjon. Pie &ndash; pai. Centerpiece &ndash; midtpunkt (lit. midpoint)  Despite us not really celebrating Thanksgiving in Norway, there is actually a historical tradition for it. This is from the celebration <b>called</b> <b>h&oslash;sttakkefest</b>, which is the Norwegian word for Thanksgiving, but is vastly different from the US version of it.  As most of us know, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a tradition that started in the 1600s after the pilgrims arrived to the United States. The exact date of the first Thanksgiving is unknown, but it is known that Thanksgiving began as a religious holiday to give thanks to God for the harvest.  Although Norwegians do not typically celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>, many American families with Scandinavian descent include things like lefse (or maybe lutefisk or fenel&aring;r) in their <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal. My family always has lefse at <b>Thanksgiving</b>, Christmas, and Easter actually.  The country is magnificent, boasting incredible natural landscapes, world-famous sights, and rich history, but taking part in one of the famous <b>Norwegian</b> celebrations is among the most remarkable experiences you can get while traveling this wonderful country.  Turkey is the main event at a <b>traditional</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner. PHOTO: bagatelle.no The &ldquo;Lille B&rdquo; restaurant attached to Oslo&rsquo;s pricey gourmet haven Bagatelle has an American chef, Derrick Styczek, who was serving a full <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner all of this week with two seatings each evening.  Common <b>Norwegian</b> words and phrases associated with Harvest festivals include &ldquo;h&oslash;stfest&rdquo; (harvest festival), &ldquo;takkefest&rdquo; (<b>thanksgiving</b> feast), &ldquo;h&oslash;sttakkefest&rdquo; (harvest <b>thanksgiving</b> festival), and &ldquo;h&oslash;stmat&rdquo; (harvest food).  <b>Thanksgiving</b> in Norway seems like a foreign concept, in more ways than one. This traditional American holiday is meant to bring families closer together over a table full of delicious food, and despite the fact that people in almost any nation can relate to this, the traditional American Thanksgiving is usually reserved for the good old U.S. of A.  Lefse is an iconic holiday food served on the tables of Norweigian Americans on <b>Thanksgiving </b>and worldwide on Christmas. This delicious potato bread is akin to a tortilla, but Scandinavian style. It is often served with toppings, such as butter, sugar, cinnamon, jellies, and even savory ingredients. </p>        <p><a href="./873.html">What vegetables to cook for thanksgiving</a>. <a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/468.html">Will cracker barrel be open on thanksgiving day</a>. <em>What restraunts in las vegas are serving thanksgiving dinner</em>.
