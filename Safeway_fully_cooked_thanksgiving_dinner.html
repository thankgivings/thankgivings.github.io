        <h2><strong>Safeway fully cooked thanksgiving dinner Thanksgiving delivery san diego</strong></h2>
        <p>This reverential Haudenosaunee <b>prayer</b> extols every aspect of nature and the benevolent will of the Great Spirit. It has been passed down for generations through the oral tradition of the Haudenosaunee people, which comprise six indigenous tribes&mdash;Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora&mdash;located in the northeastern United ...  Thanksgiving Address: Greetings to the Natural World English version: John Stokes and Kanawahienton (David Benedict, Turtle Clan/Mohawk) Mohawk <b>version</b>: <b>Rokwaho</b> (Dan Thompson, Wolf Clan/Mohawk) Original inspiration: Tekaronianekon (Jake Swamp, Wolf  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> Address (the <b>Ohen</b>:ton <b>Karihwatehkwen</b>) is the central prayer and invocation for the Haudenosaunee (also known as the Iroquois Confederacy or Six Nations &mdash; Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora). It reflects their relationship of giving thanks for life and the world around them.  The Confederacy <b>of </b>the <b>Mohawk</b>, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca nations in what is now upstate New York has been meeting for 1,000 years. United by a common goal to live in harmony, each meeting, large and small, is opened with the beautiful and incantatory Haudenosaunee <b>Thanksgiving </b>Address.  To be a human is an honor, and we offer thanksgiving for all the gifts of life. <b>Mother</b> <b>Earth</b>, we thank you for giving us everything we need. Thank you deep blue waters around Mother Earth, for you are the force that takes thirst away from all living things.  John Stokes produced a version of the Address in English, which was sanctioned by the Mohawk members of the team. This was then translated into Mohawk <b>by</b> Dan Rokwaho Thompson of the Wolf Clan. The Mohawk is included in each language version of the Address to honor the roots of these powerful words.  What was your experience of listening to Ryan recite the <b>Thanksgiving</b> Address in Mohawk, one of the Indigenous languages of the Haudenosaunee? What meaning do you gather from it? As the different elements that sustain life were named, which ones were obvious to you? Which ones were a surprise? What elements do you identify with most strongly?  In oral tradition, the <b>Rotinonhsy&oacute;n</b>:<b>ni</b> &ldquo;open&rdquo; gatherings of people with the Oh&eacute;n:ton Karihwat&eacute;hkwen, commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Opening Address&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Thanksgiving Address&rdquo;. A more literal translation, in the words of Elder Tom Porter is &ldquo;what we say before we do anything important&rdquo;.
