        <p>Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as <b>Spanish</b> and English days of feasting and prayer to become the football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today. English...  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday&#39;s</b> <b>history</b> in North <b>America</b> is rooted in English traditions dating from the Protestant Reformation. It also has aspects of a harvest festival , even though the harvest in New England occurs well before the late-November date on which the modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b> is celebrated.  Most Americans are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North <b>America</b>. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees.  Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  According to Baker, &quot;the American holiday&#39;s true origin was the <b>New</b> <b>England</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Never coupled with a Sabbath meeting, the Pilgrim observances were special days set aside during the week for thanksgiving and praise in response to God&#39;s providence.&quot;  Almost every culture in the world has celebrations of thanks for a plentiful harvest. The legend of the American Thanksgiving holiday is said to have been based on a feast of thanksgiving in the early days of the American colonies <b>almost</b> <b>400</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b>.  The United States <b>holiday</b> <b>of Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of Thanksgiving, which has been an official national holiday since President <b>Abraham</b> Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such in 1863.  Thanksgiving Day became an official U.S. holiday in <b>1863</b>, and in 1942 the federal government designated the fourth Thursday in November as Thanksgiving. A traditional Thanksgiving meal consists of turkey, cranberries, bread stuffing, and pumpkin pie, among other dishes. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving 5k san francisco.
