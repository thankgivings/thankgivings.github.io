        <h2><strong>With thanksgiving lyrics kurt carr Funny thanksgiving pictures myspace</strong></h2>
        <p>When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the Pilgrims did eat turkey in 1621, as reported by <b>Plymouth</b> governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as <b>Plymouth</b> lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of the harvest celebration shared by the Pilgrims and Wampanoag at <b>Plymouth</b> Colony in...  The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were...  Many dishes <b>served</b> during modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> meals were not present <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have potatoes, nor did they have butter or flour necessary for making pies. The pilgrims hadn&rsquo;t even built their <b>first</b> oven by the time of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  Back in 2003, we consulted with historians at Plimoth Plantation, the Wampanoag and English settlers living history museum <b>in Plymouth</b>, Massachusetts, and asked writer Jane Walsh to devise a menu that incorporated some of the <b>foods</b> that would have been <b>served</b> <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. We didn&rsquo;t eliminate any favorites or try to go sugar-free.  There&rsquo;s a good chance the Pilgrims and <b>Wampanoag</b> did in fact eat <b>turkey</b> as part of that very first Thanksgiving. Wild turkey was a common food source for people who settled Plymouth. In the days prior to the celebration, the colony&rsquo;s governor sent four men to go &ldquo;fowling&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to hunt for birds. Did they come back with any turkey?  Perhaps the strongest connection between the 1621 harvest celebration and later <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations is that both menus are based on seasonally-available <b>foods</b> with New England roots. The presence of venison, hunted and brought back to New <b>Plymouth</b> by Ousamequin&rsquo;s men, was significant.  The geographical landscape of <b>Plymouth</b> (or Plimoth Plantation as the settlers called it in 1621), was a direct link to the foods that were eaten at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Plymouth&#39;s coastal location overlooking Cape Cod Bay offered a multitude of shellfish to those who inhabited the area.  Step back in time and learn what was really eaten at the 1621 Harvest, known today as The <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.
