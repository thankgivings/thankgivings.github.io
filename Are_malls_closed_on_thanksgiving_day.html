        <p>Drivers should be safe on <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Eve</b> by planning ahead if they intend to drink. They shouldn&rsquo;t wait until after drinking to plan how to get somewhere.

During this time, which begins at 6 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 27, and concludes Sunday, Dec. 1, impaired <b>driving</b> is of particular concern. Nationwide, alcohol-impaired fatalities in 2022 represented 32% of the total traffic fatalities. During the <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day period, 35% of fatalities involved an alcohol-impaired driver.  Not coincidentally, it&#39;s also one of the deadliest days of the year for <b>drunk</b> <b>driving</b>. According to the NHTSA, there were 137 drivers involved in fatal crashes on Thanksgiving <b>Eve</b> from...  As millions of Americans gear up for <b>Thanksgiving</b> travel and gatherings, Mothers Against <b>Drunk</b> <b>Driving</b>&reg; ...

In 2022, 100 drivers were involved in fatal traffic crashes on <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Eve</b> &mdash; 35% of those drivers were <b>drunk</b>. <b>Thanksgiving</b> usually means spending quality time with loved ones, feeling grateful and, of course, food and drinks.  WASHINGTON &ndash; As millions of Americans get on the roads to travel home and spend the Thanksgiving holiday reconnecting with friends and loved ones, the U.S. Department of Transportation is serving them a reminder: &ldquo;<b>Make</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b>: <b>Don</b>&rsquo;<b>t</b> <b>Drink</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drive</b> <b>this</b> Thanksgiving Eve.&rdquo; </p>        <p>Thanksgiving wallpaper for facebook timeline.
