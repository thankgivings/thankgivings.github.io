        <h2><strong>Sighning thanksgiving songs for kids Thanksgiving blow ups</strong></h2>
        <p>In <b>Islam</b>, thanksgiving is not only a particular religious act or service; it is the whole life. The whole life should be lived in obedience to our Ultimate Benefactor, Allah. God has been good to us, and so in our thankfulness we should worship Him and obey His commands and orders.  Thanksgiving is a celebration observed on <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b> in the United States and the second Monday of October in Canada. The celebration is about giving thanks for the blessing of the harvest and of the preceding year.  What is the concept of Thanksgiving in <b>Islam</b>? Are Muslim allowed to celebrate Thanksgiving? Let&rsquo;s check out! The National Day of Thanksgiving in America is a beautiful holiday. It contains a good spirit and noble message. It is not a holiday of any particular religion.  Celebrating or imitating the believers in any of their religious festivals (holidays) is impermissible, and we as Muslims are prohibited from doing it. In this case, Thanksgiving as a <b>day</b> provided to give thanks is a foreign matter <b>in Islamic</b> teachings. Prophet Muhammad SAW also warned us from adopting the ways of non-Muslims.  It is said that <b>Thanksgiving </b>had roots <b>in </b>religious and cultural tradition but today <b>Thanksgiving </b>is primarily celebrated as a secular holiday. [1] <b>In </b>principle, imitating the disbelievers <b>in </b>any of their religious festivals (holidays) is totally impermissible and intolerable.  Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> is only a reminder. We should always thank Allah, in every breath and every moment of our lives. A Muslim knows the reason that he/she is alive, and is enjoying all kinds of opportunities and blessings is only Allah.  In Islam we have two forms of thanksgiving. The first is called <b>hamd</b> and the second is termed shukr . Hamd is to thank someone for something because they gave you something out of their generosity.  When you say: &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo;, you&rsquo;re usually saying it to someone. So, who deserves our thanks, our gratitude, and our praise? Allah says <b>in </b>the Quran, &ldquo;<b>In </b>the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. [All] praise is [due] to Allah, Lord of the worlds -&rdquo; [Noble Quran 1:1-2]  Our daily prayers, our fasting during Ramadan, our Zakat and Hajj are all our acts of <b>thanksgiving</b>. </p>        <p>Can you eat thanksgiving turkey when pregnant.
