        <p>First Thanksgiving at <b>Plymouth</b>. The Pilgrims did not call this harvest festival a &quot;Thanksgiving,&quot; although they did give thanks to God. To them, a Day of Thanksgiving was purely religious. The first recorded religious Day of Thanksgiving was held in 1623 in response to a providential rainfall. LATER SIGNIFICANCE OF THANKSGIVING  When the Mayflower returned to Europe, not a single <b>Pilgrim</b> deserted <b>Plymouth</b>. Helping Hands Massasoit, chief of the Wampanoag tribe, signed a treaty with the Pilgrams in <b>1621</b>, that was never broken.  In the Fall of 1621, the Pilgrims famously shared a harvest feast with the <b>Pokanokets</b>; the meal is now considered the basis for the Thanksgiving holiday. It took place over three days between...  The <b>Pilgrims</b>&#39; first corn harvest was successful and in November the group&#39;s leader, Governor William Bradford, called for a feast to celebrate their good fortune. Hunters were sent into the wilderness to hunt game for the event.  There are 2 (and only 2) primary sources for the events of autumn <b>1621</b> in <b>Plymouth</b>: Edward Winslow writing in Mourt&#39;s Relation and William Bradford writing in Of <b>Plymouth</b> Plantation  Every year, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>celebrations</b> teach that the English or &ldquo;<b>Pilgrims</b>&rdquo; of Plymouth Colony and local Native Americans made friends, held a great feast, and thereby permitted United States history to proceed .  In <b>Plymouth</b>, Massachusetts, colonists and Wampanoag Indians shared an autumn harvest feast in <b>1621</b> that is widely acknowledged to be one of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations.  To celebrate the first harvest at Plymouth, Governor William Bradford and the other settlers invited the <b>Wampanoags</b> for a celebratory feast in November 1621, now remembered as the first...  In November <b>1621</b>, the pilgrims celebrated a feast of thanksgiving which became known in the 19th century as &quot;The First Thanksgiving&quot;. The feast was probably held in early October 1621 and was celebrated by the 53 surviving Pilgrims, along with Massasoit and 90 of his men. </p>        <p>When is thanksgiving this year in the us.
