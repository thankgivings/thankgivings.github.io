        <h2><strong>The first thanksgiving menu in 1621 Thanksgiving turkey burger recipes</strong></h2>
        <p>The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were...  Have you ever wondered what the Pilgrims ate at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  So, they had a great deal to be thankful for at their <b>1621</b> harvest feast, even if the term &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; was not used that <b>first</b> year. Although their exact <b>menu</b> has been lost to us, Wampanoag oral history, plus a few Costco receipts left by Pilgrims, suggest that corn, beans, and squash were central to that feast.  BU Today: What do we know about the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> and what might have been included on the <b>menu</b>? Metheny: The <b>&ldquo;First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; which took place in the fall of <b>1621</b> at the site of Patuxet (present-day Plymouth, Mass.), was reflective of several English traditions: a harvest festival, typically held in the autumn after the harvest was successfully brought in, as well as a religious ...  Two primary sources&mdash;<b>the </b>only surviving documents that reference <b>the </b>meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of <b>the </b>harvest celebration shared by <b>the </b>Pilgrims and Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony <b>in</b>...  For most people, enjoying <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, apple pie. But how did the Pilgrims really...  <b>In </b>1620, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on <b>the </b>Mayflower for <b>the </b>&quot;New World&quot; and landed <b>in </b>modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by <b>the </b>Wampanoag people.  By fall 1621, the Pilgrims were essentially out of <b>sugar</b>. Translation&mdash; no cranberry sauce. Even with sugar, the Pilgrims still wouldn&rsquo;t have used it to sauce cranberries. That&rsquo;s because the tart little berry was new to them. Native Americans made dyes out of cranberries.  So what foods were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to food historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well. </p>        <p>Kroger open on new years day 2024.
