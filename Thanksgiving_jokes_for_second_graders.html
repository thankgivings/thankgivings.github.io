        <p>Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday in the United <b>States</b>, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, November 28. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people ...  It took the Civil War&mdash;and with it the perceived need for a gesture to build national unity&mdash;for Lincoln to declare a day of thanksgiving for the <b>U.S</b>. in October 1863, to be celebrated the following month. The story of the &ldquo;first Thanksgiving,&rdquo; however, is more complicated than that which is commonly taught in schools.  Plymouth Colony &amp; First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia.  It is intended to celebrate the blessings of the past year. Thanksgiving Day became an official <b>U.S</b>. holiday in 1863, and in 1942 the federal government designated the fourth Thursday in November as Thanksgiving. A traditional Thanksgiving meal consists of turkey, cranberries, bread stuffing, and pumpkin pie, among other dishes.  Whenever the holiday season comes around, annual traditions and <b>Thanksgiving </b>activities seem to explode. Family events center around each special occasion, and <b>Thanksgiving </b>is no exception ...  Thanksgiving is a <b>U.S</b>. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of Thanksgiving, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United <b>States</b>, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  Festivals of <b>Thanksgiving </b>were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years. They tended to be autumn harvest celebrations. But in 1789, Elias Boudinot, Massachusetts, member of the House of Representatives, moved that a day of <b>Thanksgiving </b>be held to thank God for giving the American people the opportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their hard won freedoms.  Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United <b>States</b> and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>In living color to gay guys on thanksgiving.
