        <p>In <b>1621</b>, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people shared an autumn harvest feast that is acknowledged as one of the first Thanksgiving celebrations in the...  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the first recorded religious Thanksgiving Day in <b>Plymouth</b> happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion,...  Several days of Thanksgiving were held in early <b>New</b> <b>England</b> history that have been identified as the &quot;First Thanksgiving&quot;, including Pilgrim holidays in Plymouth in 1621 and 1623, and a Puritan holiday in Boston in 1631.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> service known to be <b>held</b> by Europeans in North America occurred on May 27, 1578, in Newfoundland, although earlier Church-type services were probably <b>held</b> by Spaniards in La Florida.  According to the Texas Society Daughters of the American Colonists, the very first thanksgiving was observed by Spanish <b>explorer</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>Vasquez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Coronado</b>. Accompanied by 1,500 men in...  In 1620, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on the Mayflower for the &quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-<b>day</b> southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by the Wampanoag people.  Although there is evidence of earlier <b>thanksgiving</b> celebrations in the Americas by the Spanish in the 16th century and at the Jamestown Colony of Virginia in 1610, following what is known as the &ldquo;starving times&rdquo; of 1609, these are not recognized as the &ldquo;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo;, a term coined by the editor Alexander Young in 1841 referring ...  The earliest celebration was held in 1578, when an expedition led by Martin Frobisher held a ceremony in <b>present</b>-<b>day</b> <b>Nunavut</b> to give thanks for the safety of its fleet. In 1879 Parliament established a national Thanksgiving Day on November 6; the date has varied over the years.  When was the first Thanksgiving? The story behind Thanksgiving starts in 1620 when a group of Protestants, who had left their native England after they were persecuted for their religion there, landed in <b>Plymouth</b>, <b>Massachusetts</b>. </p>        <p><i>Non traditional thanksgiving sides</i>.
