        <h2><strong>When did thanksgiving become a legal holiday Best las vegas buffet thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>It was a bountiful Thanksgiving during the Centennial year! The amount of turkey available per Canadian in 2022 (<b>2.64</b> kg) is the second-lowest amount on record, behind only 1960 (2.27 kg), when we first started tracking turkey.  How many turkeys are consumed in Canada on <b>Thanksgiving</b>? <b>2.7</b> <b>million</b> whole turkeys were purchased in Canada for Thanksgiving in 2021, that&rsquo;s about 45% of the yearly turkey sales in Canada. (TurkeyFarmersofCanada) As a reminder, Thanksgiving in Canada is celebrated earlier on the second Monday of October.  The centre of the meal, of course, is the turkey and, according to the Turkey Farmers of Canada, Canadians <b>bought</b> <b>3.1</b> <b>million</b> whole <b>turkeys</b> for Thanksgiving.  Here&rsquo;s the government data behind <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner. Unless otherwise noted, all the data is from the US Department of Agriculture. <b>Turkey</b>. In 2021, farmers raised about 217 million <b>turkeys</b> and produced about 5.6 billion pounds of ready-to-cook <b>turkey</b>. That&rsquo;s an average of 26 pounds of meat per bird.  At Thanksgiving 2023, <b>2.1</b> <b>million</b> whole turkeys were purchased by Canadians, equal to 37% of all whole turkeys that were sold over the year. Christmas At Christmas 2023, 2.6 million whole turkeys were purchased by Canadians, equal to 46% of all whole turkeys that were sold over the year.  According to the National Turkey Federation, an estimated <b>88</b> <b>percent</b> of Americans consume Thanksgiving turkey each year. Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), this translates to more than 46 <b>million</b> turkeys eaten on Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving is celebrated each year on the second Monday of October. <b>20.2</b> <b>million</b> turkeys were sold. A 75 g serving of roasted light turkey meat provides 21 g of protein and 2 g of fat. Turkey farm cash receipts totalled $391.8 million. Households spent an average of $48 on potatoes in 2017.  At Christmas last year, we celebrated the season with the succulent help of <b>2.7</b> million <b>turkeys</b>, slightly edging out Thanksgiving with 42 per cent of the yearly total. WATCH BELOW: THIS IS WHY...  Consumption statistics from the Turkey Farmers of Canada, the national voice of Canadian turkey farmers, show that <b>2.7</b> <b>million</b> whole turkeys were purchased by Canadians during the 2021 Thanksgiving holiday, equal to 45 percent of all turkeys that were sold last year. This is 600,000 more turkeys than were purchased at Christmas! </p>        <p>Costco thanksgiving decorations. Thanksgiving traffic today. Funny poems about thanksgiving.
