        <h2><strong>Awesome thanksgiving hand turkeys Texas station thanksgiving buffet</strong></h2>
        <p>Long before social-distancing and lockdowns, there was a <b>Muslim</b> divide on whether to <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> or not. It is as clear as black and white, halal or haram for many <b>Muslims</b>. Pro-<b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Muslims</b> say you are encouraging good family relations and making special acknowledgments of thanks on the non-religious holiday .  Unlike those holidays, however, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a non-religious, cultural holiday, with ideals that are fully in tune with the Islamic ethos &mdash; and it happens to be one of my favorites. Almost all...  New <b>Muslims</b> should understand that celebrating <b>thanksgiving</b> is not the sixth pillar of Islam or the seventh article of faith. If you decide not to participate, it is up to you. We are talking about cases in which you are invited to a family gathering.  1- A <b>Muslim</b> is allowed to <b>celebrate</b> any national occasion as long as it does not include any rituals that violate Shariah rulings. 2- So, a <b>Muslim</b> in America can share his family members celebrating <b>Thanksgiving</b> providing that he does not participate in any non-Islamic rituals or have any prohibited (haram) foods or drinks.  Although Thanksgiving is <b>not</b> a religious holiday or observance and is not commemorated as such, Muslims in America are naturally drawn to this holiday because of the spirit of gratitude and service that it embodies. This American spirit of giving thanks is actually enshrined in Islam.  As Muslims we thank every day of our lives; we appreciate and never take for granted all that Allah has given us. We also engage in thanking people for their good acts, deeds, or favors they have heaped on us. Our thankfulness is called &lsquo; <b>Tashakkur</b> &rsquo; in Arabic and &lsquo; Shukriya &rsquo; in Urdu language.  Our daily Prayers, our fasting during Ramadan, our zakah and Hajj are all our acts of <b>thanksgiving</b>. We should <b>do</b> them not only as duties that must be performed but as our gratitude to our Lord and Creator.  In Islam we have two forms of thanksgiving. The first is called <b>hamd</b> and the second is termed shukr. Hamd is to thank someone for something because they gave you something out of their generosity. When someone demonstrates kindness to you and doesn&rsquo;t expect anything in return from you, your thanking them is called hamd.  Source: WEB [prokerala.com | Photo: Mohammed Jafer/ANS] The United States is not the only country with a &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; celebration. Personally, I <b>do</b> not view <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a religious holiday&mdash;at least not one that is specific to Islam or Christianity (or any other religion). </p>        <p><a href="./218.html">Las vegas weather thanksgiving week</a>.
