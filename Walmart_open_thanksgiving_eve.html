        <p>But while we&#39;re on the subject, ever wonder why we carve our gobblers on the fourth Thursday of November? Hint: <b>It</b>&#39;<b>s</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> Thanksgiving Thursday <b>is</b> more <b>alliterative</b> than...  Since <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>always</b> takes place on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> of November, it follows roughly a 28-year cycle, which is only interrupted by century years and leap years. Therefore,...  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  By federal law, Americans have celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> in November since 1942, but numerous other dates were designated in the past. It is believed that America&rsquo;s first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, actually a harvest feast that brought together 53 Pilgrims and some 90 Native Americans, occurred in the <b>fall</b> of 1621. Beginning in 1668 ...  Historians don&rsquo;t know exactly which day <b>the </b>&quot;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; between <b>the </b>Pilgrims and Native Americans fell <b>on </b>&mdash; and it actually happened in October, not November, according to <b>the </b>Farmer&rsquo;s...  Unlike other holidays, such as Dec. 25 for Christmas or Oct. 31 for Halloween, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was not <b>always</b> a consistent day. <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been federally recognized as the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> in ...  On October 31 st of that year, FDR acquiesced to business owners&rsquo; lobbying and declared that <b>Thanksgiving</b> would <b>fall</b> on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> of the month, November 23 rd. There were plenty of critics of this decision, and because calendars had already been printed for the year and football games and school closings had already been scheduled ...  Our 32nd president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, is responsible for Americans celebrating Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday, which is sometimes but not always the <b>last</b> Thursday in November. But there are a few twists and turns to the story, and ultimately it took an Act of Congress to get the deal done.  <b>The </b>United States celebrates <b>Thanksgiving </b>as a national holiday <b>on the fourth Thursday </b>in November. In 2024, <b>Thanksgiving </b>will be observed <b>on Thursday</b>, November 28. <b>Thanksgiving </b>has been held <b>on the fourth Thursday </b>in November since 1941, which means that <b>the </b>date of <b>the </b>holiday shifts each year. </p>        <p>The woodlands thanksgiving dinner.
