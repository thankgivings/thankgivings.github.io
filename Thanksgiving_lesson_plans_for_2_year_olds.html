        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving lesson plans for 2 year olds Cultivars of white thanksgiving cactus</strong></h2>
        <p>Could it be that the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast was based on what they had seen of the Jewish Sukkot celebrations, the Feast of Ingathering? There is certainly plenty in common&hellip; &ndash; Both involve pilgrims!  The final holiday in the biblical calendar, the Feast of Tabernacles, called Sukkot in <b>Hebrew</b>, has arrived. All across Israel, booths (sukkot) are set up next to homes <b>and </b>restaurants to observe one of the most festive holidays in the Jewish calendar. What is the Feast of Tabernacles?  Sukkot is a Jewish autumn festival of double <b>thanksgiving </b>that begins on the 15th day of Tishri (in September or October), five days after Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. It is one of the three Pilgrim Festivals of the <b>Hebrew </b>Bible.  &ldquo;Seeing themselves as new <b>Israelites</b> in a new &lsquo;promised land,&rsquo; the Pilgrims surely found inspiration in the Bible, in the Books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, in which God commands the ancient <b>Israelites</b> to observe the Feast of Booths&mdash;in Hebrew, Sukkot, &lsquo;To rejoice before Adonai your God&rsquo; at the time of the fall harvest.&rdquo;  England was Egypt, the king was Pharaoh, the Atlantic Ocean their Red Sea, and the Puritans were the <b>Israelites</b>, entering into a new covenant with God in a new Promised Land. In fact, most of the Puritans had Hebrew names and there was even a proposal to make Hebrew the language of the colonies!  The most frequent call for thanksgiving is worth learning in Hebrew because it is a part of many prayers and because Hebrew is considered the intimate tongue of God it may be a good idea to confess this call for thanksgiving in Hebrew: &lsquo;<b>Ho</b>&bull;<b>d&uacute;</b> <b>la</b>&bull;<b>Adon&aacute;i</b> <b>ki</b> <b>tov</b> ki <b>le</b>&bull;<b>o</b>&bull;<b>lam</b> <b>chas</b>&bull;<b>do</b>&rsquo;.  Rabbi Eric Eisenkramer (Reform Judaism.org) explains that &ldquo;There are strong historical connections between Judaism <b>and Thanksgiving</b>. Most of the Pilgrims who celebrated the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>...  Sukkot, also known as the Feast of Tabernacles, is a Jewish holiday celebrated on the 15 th of Tishrei on the <b>Hebrew </b>calendar. While not as widely known or celebrated as some other Jewish holidays, Sukkot is a very important part of the Jewish experience.  Here are five intriguing connections that might even spark a conversation around your <b>Thanksgiving</b> or Friendsgiving table. 1.
