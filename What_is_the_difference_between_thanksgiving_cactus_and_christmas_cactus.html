        <p>Use our Thanksgiving <b>salad</b> recipe as a starting point and customize this <b>salad</b> to your preferences (and menu!). Here are 3 variations to try: Instead of massaged <b>kale</b>, use any of these greens as the salad base: You don&rsquo;t have to stop just at goat cheese, candied walnuts, apples, and dried cherries!  Next, thoroughly toss the pecan vinaigrette with stemmed, chopped <b>kale</b> and let time do its magic. The thick dressing coats every piece of <b>kale</b>, and after a few hours in the fridge, the dressing breaks down and softens the hearty greens.  Holiday <b>Kale</b> <b>Salad</b> with Maple Mustard Dressing adds a little color to your Thanksgiving feast! It&#39;s perfect for Christmas dinner, too. Made with <b>kale</b>, butternut squash, pecans, and pomegranate seeds, this healthy salad is a nice change of pace from the usual heavy holiday food.  Crisp and sweet <b>vegan</b> fall harvest <b>salad</b> with apples, <b>kale</b> and roasted squash. Ideal for a light Thanksgiving side or a nourishing fall lunch!
