        <h2><strong>Night before thanksgiving going out American thanksgiving blessing</strong></h2>
        <p>In 1637 near present day Groton, Connecticut, over 700 men, women and children of the <b>Pequot</b> Tribe had gathered for their annual Green Corn Festival which is our <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration. In the predawn hours the sleeping Indians were surrounded by English and Dutch mercenaries who ordered them to come outside.  One infamous example took place on the banks of the Mystic River during an event known as the <b>Pequot</b> War of 1637, a conflict that might better be named the Anglo-Pequot War.  The Mystic <b>massacre</b> &ndash; also known as the Pequot massacre and the Battle of Mystic Fort &ndash; took place on May 26, 1637 during the Pequot War, when a force from the Connecticut Colony under Captain John Mason and their Narragansett and Mohegan allies set fire to the Pequot Fort near the Mystic River.  The <b>Pequot</b> War was one of the bloodiest Indian wars ever fought. In 1637 near present day Groton, Connecticut, over 700 men, women and children of the <b>Pequot</b> Tribe had gathered for their annual Green Corn Festival which is our <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration.  On <b>June</b> <b>5</b>, Captain Mason attacks a Pequot village near present-day Stonington and massacres the community. Following an especially successful raid against the Pequot in what is now Stamford, Connecticut, the churches announce a second day of &ldquo;thanksgiving&rdquo; to celebrate victory.  A pre-dawn attack on Mystic Fort that left 500 adults and children of the <b>Pequot</b> tribe dead, the <b>Pequot</b> <b>Massacre</b> (or the &ldquo;Mystic <b>Massacre</b>&rdquo;) was the first defeat of the <b>Pequot</b> people by the English in the <b>Pequot</b> War, a three-year war instigated by the Puritans to seize the tribe&rsquo;s traditional land.  The <b>Pequot</b> <b>War</b> was one of the bloodiest Indian wars ever fought. In 1637 near present day Groton, Connecticut, over 700 men, women and children of the Pequot Tribe had gathered for their annual Green Corn Festival which is our Thanksgiving celebration.  The first official mention of a &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; celebration occurs in 1637, after the colonists brutally <b>massacre</b> an entire <b>Pequot</b> village, then subsequently celebrate their barbaric victory.  A prevalent opposing viewpoint is that the first Thanksgiving stemmed from the <b>massacre</b> of <b>Pequot</b> people in 1637, a culmination of the Pequot War. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving spin.
