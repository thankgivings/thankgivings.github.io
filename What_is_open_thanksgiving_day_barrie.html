        <h2><strong>What is open thanksgiving day barrie What restaurants are open on thanksgiving in cobb county</strong></h2>
        <p>The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as <b>pilgrims</b>) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  In the fall of 1621, the <b>Pilgrims</b> famously shared a harvest feast with the Pokanokets; the meal is now considered the basis for the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday.
