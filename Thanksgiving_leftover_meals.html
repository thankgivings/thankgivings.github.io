        <p>Today, the traditional Thanksgiving dinner includes any number of dishes: <b>turkey</b>, stuffing, mashed potatoes, candied yams, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie.  What was the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>food</b>? Find out what was served at the very first <b>Thanksgiving</b> (and what <b>wasn</b>&#39;<b>t</b>) from wildfowl to produce.  Massasoit sent some of his own men to hunt deer for the <b>feast</b> and for three days, the English and native men, women, and children ate together. The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and...  BU Today: What do we know about the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> and what might have been included on the menu? Metheny: The &ldquo;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; which took place in the fall of 1621 at the site of Patuxet (present-day Plymouth, Mass.), was reflective of several English traditions: a harvest festival, typically held in the autumn after the harvest was successfully brought in, as well as a religious ...  <b>Turkey</b>, <b>corn</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> are all Thanksgiving staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the first Thanksgiving? The answer might surprise you!  So <b>what foods</b> <b>were</b> <b>served</b> at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  There&rsquo;s no question that <b>food</b> provided by the Wampanoags throughout the winter of 1620-21 saved the Pilgrims from certain death. So, they had a great deal to be thankful for at their 1621 harvest <b>feast</b>, even if the term &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; was not used that <b>first</b> year.  From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  What you thought was eaten at the first Thanksgiving is probably historically inaccurate. The feast featured autumnal <b>foods</b> native to Massachusetts. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving meal deals 2024. Restaurants open on thanksgiving 2024 in las vegas. Thanksgiving message church.
