        <p>ONE of the last messages of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy to his fellow countrymen was the Thanksgiving Day Proclamation which he issued on <b>November</b> <b>4</b>, <b>1963</b>. I urge that his proclamation be read in the churches of the United States in their services on November 28 as a memorial to him.  In the week between Kennedy&rsquo;s death <b>and </b>the <b>Thanksgiving </b>holiday, Johnson reached out to scores of union leaders, civil rights activists, current <b>and </b>former legislators, public intellectuals <b>and</b>...  The final Thanksgiving Proclamation from President Kennedy was widely published on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> 28, 1963, six days after his death the previous Friday. The unedited text of all three of the Massachusetts Democrat&rsquo;s proclamations follow, in chronological order: Proclamation 3438; Thanksgiving Day 1961.  WHEREAS, on October <b>25</b>, <b>1963</b>, a Proclamation setting aside November 28, 1963, as a day of Thanksgiving and Prayer was signed by me; and WHEREAS, since that date Our Beloved President, John F. Kennedy, was tragically assassinated.  <b>35th</b> President of the United States: 1961 ‐ 1963. Over three centuries ago, our forefathers in Virginia and in Massachusetts, far from home in a lonely wilderness, set aside a time of thanksgiving.  Back to the <b>day</b> of the pilgrims and the native americans - who decided to work together to help each other survive and then celebrated with a feast that lasted 3 whole days. Even though Thanksgiving has been around for 300 years it wasn&#39;t until 1863 when it that became an official American holiday.  More than any generation before us, we have cause to be thankful, so thankful, on this Thanksgiving <b>Day</b>. Our harvests are bountiful, our factories flourish, our homes are safe, our defenses are secure. We live in peace. The good will of the world pours out for us.  THANKSGIVING <b>DAY</b>, <b>1963</b> November 4,<b>1963</b> By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Over three centuries ago, our forefathers in Virginia and in Massa&shy; chusetts, far from home in a lonely wilderness, set aside a time of thanksgiving.
