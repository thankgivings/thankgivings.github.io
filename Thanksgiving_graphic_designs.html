        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving graphic designs Allergen free thanksgiving recipes</strong></h2>
        <p>The most popular Thanksgiving event in Germany is the annual Thanksgiving Day Parade in Berlin, which takes place on the first Saturday <b>of</b> <b>October</b>. This parade attracts thousands of spectators each year, who come to see the colorful floats, marching bands, and dance troupes.  Each year, the Harvest Festival takes place on the <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b>, and very often right after the German grape harvest festival (better known as Oktoberfest). For your convenience, here&rsquo;s a list of this holiday&rsquo;s date for the next ten years.  Today, the German tradition of Erntedank is mainly a religious holiday. While there are some slight differences in the exact date of Erntedank, celebrations, church services, and parades are usually held the <b>first</b> Sunday <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. Erntedank still pays tribute to the work accomplished in Germany&rsquo;s fields and gardens.  Per the recommendation of the German Catholic Church, German Thanksgiving Day is typically observed on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> in <b>October</b>. But the exact date of festivities varies from region to region. For example, the Swiss and Austrians usually celebrate in mid-September.  In German-speaking countries, Erntedankfest is often celebrated on the <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> in <b>October</b>, which is usually also the first Sunday following Michaelistag or Michaelmas (29 Sept.), but various locales may give thanks at different times during September and October.  When Is Erntedankfest Celebrated? As decreased by the Catholic church in 1972, in German-speaking countries the Erntedankfest is celebrated on the <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> in <b>October</b>, which is usually also the first Sunday following Michaelistag or Michaelmas (29 Sept.)  It <b>is </b>not an official German holiday but still a popular date in the German calendar, especially at daycares and pre-schools, at the end of September or early October, with most church services taking place on the first Sunday of October, which falls on October 2 in 2022.  In Germany, Thanksgiving&mdash; (&ldquo;das Erntedankfest,&rdquo; i.e.,Thanksgiving Harvest Festival)&mdash;is strongly entrenched in German culture. Erntedankfest is usually observed on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> (<b>04</b> <b>October</b> <b>2015</b> <b>this</b> year), although the timing is not hard and fast nationwide.  When is Erntedankfest in Germany? Unlike the American Thanksgiving, which almost always falls on the fourth Thursday <b>of</b> November, there is no one fixed date for Erntedankfeste. Depending on the region, harvest festivals in Germany usually take place in September or October, most commonly on the first Sunday in October. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving table setting.
