        <p><b>November</b> <b>17</b>-<b>21</b> &ndash; moderate crowds before Thanksgiving guests arrive; November 22-23 &ndash; heavy crowds arrive for the Thanksgiving holiday; November 24-30 &ndash; peak Thanksgiving crowds  <b>Thanksgiving</b> will top off a very <b>crowded</b> month at Walt Disney World and will definitely be more visitors than locals in the parks. This will set up how Walt Disney World will close the rest of 2024. If you are at all concerned about <b>crowds</b>, any time around <b>Thanksgiving</b> should be avoided.  Next week <b>is</b> Thanksgiving, which means many families will have several days off of work and school to travel. This week typically brings big crowds to the Disney World parks, and along with those crowds, we get LONG wait times. Experience Magic Kingdom like a pro!  Thanksgiving crowds will start arriving on <b>Friday</b>, November <b>22</b>, 2024 and continue for the week that follows. They typically peak on Monday or Tuesday, but it varies by park. In particular, avoid Magic Kingdom on days with full operating hours that are nestled between multiple days of early closures due to Mickey&rsquo;s Very Merry Christmas Party.  Offering a bit more insight here, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>week</b> <b>crowds</b> tend to be worst the Sunday through Tuesday <b>before</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>before</b> a comparative lull on late Wednesday and early Thursday. (Those time frames are still bad, just not the threat level midnight <b>crowds</b> of the prior 3 days.)  In the Disney World <b>crowd</b> calendar below you&#39;ll see the <b>crowd</b> ratings for all four theme parks, notable dates that may impact <b>crowds</b>, and the calendar dates for Walt Disney World events. Click on the specific event or crowd rating below for more information.  Whether or not you&rsquo;re attending the after-hours event during your visit the week <b>of</b> <b>November</b> <b>14th</b>, there&rsquo;s plenty of seasonal happenings to take part in! Let&rsquo;s recap what the latest park hours and Park Pass Reservation availability looks like before we head into next week.  These free Walt Disney World <b>crowd</b> calendars rate dates so you can choose best weeks to go &amp; avoid the worst, skipping long lines and high wait times. We cover seasonal events, weather, park hours, Orlando travel trends, and factors impacting when to visit Florida&rsquo;s theme parks.  Throughout the week, crowds continue to build, with the <b>Saturday</b>-<b>Wednesday</b> before Thanksgiving generally being slightly less busy than Thursday-Sunday. If you&rsquo;re planning to be there for the whole week, get in some quality park touring time at the beginning of your trip before crowds really ramp up. </p>        <p><a href="./177.html">Thanksgiving celebration speech</a>.
