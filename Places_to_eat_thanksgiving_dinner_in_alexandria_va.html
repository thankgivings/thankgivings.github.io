        <p>Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the <b>1621</b> harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion,...  When Americans rediscovered Winslow&#39;s account in <b>1822</b>, the unremarkable harvest feast of 1621 was elevated to become the &ldquo;First Thanksgiving.&rdquo; 6 By that time, American Thanksgiving practices had come to resemble that earlier feast.  The First Thanksgiving <b>1621</b>, oil on canvas by <b>Jean</b> Leon Gerome Ferris (1899). The painting shows common misconceptions about the event which persist to modern times: Pilgrims did not wear such outfits, nor did they eat at a dinner table, and the Wampanoag are dressed in the style of Native Americans from the Great Plains .  Nearly all of what historians have learned about one of the first Thanksgiving comes from a single eyewitness report: a letter written <b>in</b> <b>December</b> <b>1621</b> by <b>Edward</b> <b>Winslow</b>, one of the 100...

The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast <b>celebrated</b> by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of <b>1621</b>.  The Pilgrims and Wampanoag shared a harvest feast, but it didn&#39;t happen the way you were likely taught in school. Every November, Americans gather around the table to <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in ...  In 1621, the <b>Plymouth</b> colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people shared an autumn harvest feast that is acknowledged as one of the first Thanksgiving celebrations in the...  Metheny: The <b>&ldquo;First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; which took place in the fall of <b>1621</b> at the site of Patuxet (present-day Plymouth, Mass.), was reflective of several English traditions: a harvest festival, typically held in the autumn after the harvest was successfully brought in, as well as a religious tradition of fasting and prayer, followed by ... </p>        <p><a href="./545.html">Workout before thanksgiving</a>.
