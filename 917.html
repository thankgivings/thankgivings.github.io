        <h2><strong>Recipe for turkey breast with mushrooms The first thanksgiving day was held in</strong></h2>
        <p>&quot;A great <b>turkey</b> <b>recipe</b> using the slow cooker.&quot; Place the <b>turkey</b>, skin side up, in a 5 quart slow cooker. Brush with butter. Sprinkle with parsley, tarragon, salt and pepper. Top with mushrooms. Pour wine over all. Cover and cook on LOW for 7-8 hours. Remove turkey and keep warm. Skim fat from cooking juices.  Making a simple <b>turkey</b> stroganoff is a delicious way of preparing <b>turkey</b>. This healthy, naturally low in fat meat tastes fantastic with a rich and creamy sauce. Traditional stroganoff <b>recipes</b> call for sour cream but I used fromage frais (fromage blanc) in order to keep the fat content to the minimum.  Whether you&#39;re looking to repurpose turkey leftovers or just want to enjoy turkey in casserole form, this cozy <b>Turkey</b> Mushroom Bake with creamy sauce is a fantastic keto-friendly and gluten-free dinner &mdash; no noodles needed. Prepare: Preheat oven to 375 F. Set aside 8&times;8 inch baking dish or any high-sided 2-quart baking dish; no need to grease.  Heat to boiling over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with wire whisk. Boil and stir about 1 minute or until mixture thickens. Stir in <b>mushrooms</b> and onions from pan. Simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in salt and pepper to taste. Serve gravy with <b>turkey</b>.  In a large shallow dish, mix flour, oregano, paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Dip cutlets in flour mixture to coat both sides; shake off excess. In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. In batches, add <b>turkey</b> and cook until no longer pink, 1-2 minutes on each side; remove from pan.  Fresh <b>mushrooms</b> star in this tender <b>turkey</b> entree that comes together in 15 minutes. Served with a side of brown rice, it makes a light but satisfying dinner. &mdash;Nancy Zimmerman, Cape May Court House, New Jersey  In this heart-healthy dish, <b>mushrooms</b> are used to accent lean <b>turkey</b> <b>breasts</b> that are lightly saut&eacute;ed. The <b>turkey</b> and <b>mushrooms</b> are then kicked up a notch thanks to a sauce made from broth, wine and fresh herbs.  This <b>Turkey</b> &amp; <b>Mushrooms</b> in a Creamy White Wine Sauce is a great dinner any day of the week. Lightly seasoned <b>turkey</b> cutlets cooked in a rich white wine sauce with <b>mushrooms</b> and onions. Great served with Fluffy Mashed Potatoes.  The <b>Turkey</b> Cutlets with <b>Mushroom</b> Cream Sauce <b>recipe</b> is made in 30 minutes. The meat is juicy and tender, and the sauce is creamy.
