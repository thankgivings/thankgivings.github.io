        <p>The Beloved <b>Akathist</b>, Glory to God for All Things In our parish, we traditionally chant this beloved Akathist around the time of the Church New Year (September 1), on the eve of the American holiday of Thanksgiving in Noivember, and occasionally at the beginning of the Civil New Year on January 1.  O <b>King</b> of ages, Who, by the power of Your salvific providence, holds in Your right hand all the ways of man&rsquo;s life: I thank You for all Your visible and secret goods, for earthly life and for the heavenly joy of Your future Kingdom. Pour forth richly Your grace, in the future as well, on us who sing to You: Glory to You, O God, forever!  This <b>Akathist</b>, also called the &ldquo;<b>Akathist</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; was found among the effects of Protopresbyter Gregory Petrov upon his death in a prison camp in 1940. The title is from the last words of Saint John Chrysostom as he was dying in exile.  O <b>King</b> of <b>ages</b>, Who, by the power of Thy salvific providence, holdeth in Thy right hand all the ways of man&rsquo;s life: I thank Thee for all Thy visible and secret goods, for earthly life and for the heavenly joy of Thy future Kingdom. Pour forth richly Thy grace, in the future as well, on us who sing to Thee: Glory to Thee, O God, in ages!  The <b>Akathist</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, &lsquo;Glory to God for All Things&rsquo;, was long attributed to Hieromartyr Gregory Petrov (+ 194?). The attribution has now been authoritatively made to Metropolitan Tryphon (Turkestanov) (+ 1934) and the <b>akathist</b> is one of the most popular texts of contemporary Orthodox piety in Russia.  Pour forth richly Thy grace, in the future as well, on us who sing to Thee: Glory to Thee, O God, in ages! I was born on earth as a feeble and helpless child, but Thy angel, spreading his shiny wings, has sheltered my cradle. From that moment Thy love shines in all my ways and miraculously guides me into the light <b>of </b>eternity.  This <b>Akathist</b> was found among the effects of Protopresbyter Gregory Petrov upon his death in a prison camp in 1940. The title is taken from the words of Saint John Chrysostom as he was dying in exile. It is a song of praise from amidst the most terrible suffering. <b>Thanksgiving</b> and Prayer as a celebration is understood perhaps best by one  &ldquo;<b>Glory</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> <b>for</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b>&rdquo; 2 An Akathist of Thanksgiving joy and gladness; the bones that be humbled, they shall rejoice. Turn Thy face away from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore  <b>The</b> <b>Akathist</b> Hymn: &quot;<b>Glory</b> to God for All Things&quot; This Akathist, also called the &quot;Akathist of Thanksgiving,&quot; was found among the effects of Protopresbyter Gregory Petrov upon his death in a prison camp in 1940. The title is from the words of Saint John Chrysostom as he was dying in exile. </p>        <p><a href="./467.html">Thanksgiving american menu</a>. <em>Wishes in thanksgiving for friends</em>.
