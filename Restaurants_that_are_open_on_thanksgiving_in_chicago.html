        <h2><strong>Restaurants that are open on thanksgiving in chicago In which restaurant they serve thanksgiving lunches</strong></h2>
        <p>complete list of all <b>Hindu</b> festivals and celebrations. The position of Sun and Moon determines the date and time of the <b>Hindu</b> festivals  Here are some of the more widely celebrated <b>Hindu</b> holidays and days of significance to Dharma traditions for accommodation, observation, and celebration.  <b>Pongal</b> is one such big festival, celebrated every year in mid-January--mostly in the south of India and especially in Tamil Nadu--to mark the harvest of crops and offer a special thanksgiving to God, the sun, the earth, and the cattle.  There are 12 months in the <b>Hindu</b> calendar, with the new year falling between mid-March and mid-April on the Western calendar. This list organizes important <b>Hindu</b> festivals and holy days according to the Gregorian calendar for the years 2019 through 2025.  Since saying of grace before food is not a traditional custom in India where often food was sanctified and served, this is new territory for Hindus. In fact, even for the South Indian festival of Pongal which is generally interpreted as <b>thanksgiving</b>, there are no specific prayers, says Narayanan.  A joyous ancient ritual of <b>thanksgiving</b> celebrates the divine source of the sustenance of our lives BY ANANTHA KRISHNAN, TAMIL NADU RICE IS THE STAPLE FOOD FOR US HERE in South Asia and the annabhishekam, &ldquo;food bath,&rdquo; with cooked rice for God Siva, is an act of thanks to the cosmic energy for providing us this magical grain.  Since saying of &lsquo;Grace&rsquo; before food is not a traditional custom in India where often food was sanctified and served, this is new territory for <b>Hindus</b>.  Many <b>Hindu</b> festivals are celebrated across India, while others are localized within specific regional communities. The festivals are filled with mirth and merriment, music and dance, expressions of religious devotion, and plenty of delicious food and sweets.  Hindus across India observe the day with different names and customs. Sikhs also observe it as an important holiday marking the New Year and the start of the Khalsa warrior community. <b>Vaisakhi</b> is a joyous and colorful time of thanksgiving, dance, music and feasting. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving date in united states.
