        <p>By using these alternative names, individuals can shift the focus from a Eurocentric perspective to a more inclusive celebration that recognizes the diverse origins of Thanksgiving. One alternative name for Thanksgiving <b>is</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>Peoples</b>&rsquo; Day <b>of</b> <b>Gratitude</b>.  Call <b>it</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>Foods</b> Day, suggests Craig. Get away from the master narrative of lies that have been told and retold for generations &mdash; that Thanksgiving was a day of peace. And recognize so much of the iconic imagery surrounding the holiday is really about Native foods. Turkey, pumpkin, cranberries, squash, corn &mdash; they&rsquo;re all Native.  President George Washington declared Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789 as a &quot;Day of Publick <b>Thanksgivin</b>,&quot; after he was asked by the first Federal Congress, according to the National Archives. It was the...  Ideas for a new name range <b>from</b> <b>Gratitude</b> Day to Harvest Gathering to Unity Feast. All of these options highlight the core values of Thanksgiving &ndash; gratitude, togetherness, and celebration &ndash; in a more inclusive manner.  The colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Company, not the Plymouth Colony, decreed a day of <b>thanksgiving</b> for their victory which is often interpreted by modern-day Native Americans as the basis for the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday which many observe as a Day of Mourning and reflection.

The classic virtue name <b>Grace</b>, an element of gratitude or the prayer we say before the big holiday meal, was long the top Thanksgiving name for girls, but today that honor goes to the golden autumn name Aurelia.  Contemporary <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a cookie-cutter, food-based lie meant to make a very particular class and color of people feel good about peace. It&rsquo;s a colonial unifier, notes Chef Nephi Craig ...  Later in <b>New</b> England, religious <b>thanksgiving</b> services were declared by civil leaders such as Governor Bradford, who planned the Plymouth colony&#39;s <b>thanksgiving</b> celebration and feast in 1623. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Bradford issued a proclamation of <b>Thanksgiving</b> following victory in the Pequot War in the late 1630s to celebrate &quot;the bloody victory ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, observed in 2024 on Thursday, November 28, honors a 1621 feast between Plymouth colonists and the Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving meals in restaurants.
