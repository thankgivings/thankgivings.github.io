For American culture, the story of the <b>Pilgrims</b>, including their &ldquo;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; feast with the local Native Americans, has become the ruling creation narrative, celebrated each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games.  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the first recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623.
