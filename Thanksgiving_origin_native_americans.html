        <p>English explorer Sir Martin Frobisher and his crew <b>first</b> got their thanks on in Newfoundland in 1578, which is widely accepted at the <b>first</b> celebration of <b>Thanksgiving</b> in North America (there...  While <b>Thanksgiving</b> wasn&#39;t declared a national holiday in Canada until 1879, the <b>first</b> <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> is recognized as happening as far back as 1578. English explorer Martin Frobisher and his crew were looking for a Northwest Passage, and after a series of storms in the Arctic, the fleet came back together in what is now Newfoundland, Canada.  <b>Canadian</b> troops attend a <b>Thanksgiving</b> Mass in the bombed-out Cambrai Cathedral, France, in October 1918. According to some historians, the <b>first</b> celebration of <b>Thanksgiving</b> in North America occurred in 1579 after the safe landing of Martin Frobisher &#39;s fleet in Newfoundland [ 19 ] after an unsuccessful attempt in search of the Northwest Passage ...  English <b>explorer</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> hosted the first Canadian Thanksgiving. It was held in what is now Newfoundland during his expedition&#39;s attempts to find the Northwest Passage to the Orient in 1578 and marked their safe arrival to the New World.  In Canada, the celebration draws from three traditions: European harvest traditions, <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b>&#39;<b>s</b> 1578 Thanksgiving in the Eastern Arctic, which is the first North American celebration by that name, and the 1621 Thanksgiving of the Pilgrims on occasion of their first harvest.  The first official, annual Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>, though Indigenous peoples in Canada have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  This is now accepted as the <b>first</b> &ldquo;<b>Canadian</b>&rdquo; <b>Thanksgiving</b>, forty-three years before the <b>first</b> &ldquo;<b>American</b>&rdquo; <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Forty-eight years later on November 14, 1606, inhabitants of New France under Samuel de Champlain held huge feasts of <b>thanksgiving</b> between local Mi&rsquo;kmaq and the French.  It is said that the <b>first</b> annual <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was celebrated on 6 November 1879. Sir Martin Frobisher and his crew are credited as the <b>first</b> Europeans to have celebrated a <b>Thanksgiving</b> ceremony in North America, close to Nunavut in 1578. They ate a meal of salt beef, biscuits and mushy peas to celebrate their safe arrival.  Thanksgiving became a national affair in Canada starting in <b>1859</b>, again beating the United States to the pumpkin pie. </p>        <p>Fresh turkeys for thanksgiving uk.
