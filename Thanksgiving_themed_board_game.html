        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving themed board game Favorite cakes for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p><b>On</b> <b>November</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1943</b>, amidst the fighting of World War II (1939&ndash;1945), a copy of this painting appeared on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post urging readers to remember others less fortunate than themselves on a holiday devoted to gratitude.  In today&rsquo;s Masterpiece Story, we are featuring Freedom from Want, created by American painter and illustrator <b>Norman Rockwell</b>. It captures the Idealism held in World War II America and is one of the quintessential portrayals of <b>Thanksgiving </b>in art.  It is a picture that has come to be synonymous with Thanksgiving and happens to be one of <b>Norman</b> <b>Rockwell</b>&rsquo;s most famous paintings. Here&rsquo;s a look at the history of that painting and how it changed people&rsquo;s opinion about the U.S.&rsquo;s involvement in World War II.  Norman Rockwell&rsquo;s Thanksgiving painting is undeniably <b>iconic</b> in American art <b>history</b>. However, this can extend given its prolific parodying from across a spectrum of popular culture.  Freedom from Want, also known as The Thanksgiving Picture or I&#39;ll Be Home for Christmas, is the third of the Four Freedoms series of four oil paintings by American artist <b>Norman</b> <b>Rockwell</b>. The works were inspired by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s 1941 State of the Union Address, known as Four Freedoms.  Freedom from Want depicted friends and family of Norman Rockwell at the Thanksgiving table; the work first appeared in the Saturday Evening Post on March <b>6</b>, <b>1943</b>.  Between February and March 1943 four consecutive essays were written about the Four <b>Freedoms</b>: Freedom from Fear, Freedom of Worship, Freedom of Speech, and Freedom from Want (Thanksgiving painting) -each essay was accompanied by a Norman Rockwell painting.  <b>Norman</b> <b>Rockwell</b>&rsquo;s Freedom From Want is one of the most iconic (and parodied) paintings of the 20th century&mdash;it&rsquo;s the Thanksgiving painting we know without even necessarily knowing its name. Appearing in the March 6, 1943 edition of the Saturday Evening Post, it depicts a white, middle-class family seated around a crisply adorned dinner table.  <b>Norman</b> <b>Rockwell</b>, Freedom From Want, 1943, Norman Rockwell Museum, Stockbridge, MA, USA. Here it is, the iconic Thanksgiving turkey! The Freedom From Want is the third painting of the Four Freedoms series by American artist Norman Rockwell (1894&ndash;1978). </p>        <p>Thanksgiving football 2024 online.
