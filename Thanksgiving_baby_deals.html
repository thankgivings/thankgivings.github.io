        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving baby deals Cut and paste coloring cute thanksgiving coloring turkey</strong></h2>
        <p>In this article I take a brief look at the origins of Thanksgiving and its celebration here in Canada, given that we will all be celebrating <b>on</b> <b>October</b> <b>14th</b>. We all learned as children about the American Thanksgiving myth of the first US Thanksgiving but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  Many of the trappings of Canadian Thanksgiving are similar to those of its U.S. counterpart, but the Canadian tradition belongs to the <b>16th</b> <b>century</b>, more than four decades before the historic...  Thanksgiving didn&rsquo;t really take hold in Canada until the <b>19th</b> <b>century</b>, which, surprisingly, is also when it became a popular tradition in the United States.  Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is rooted in Indigenous values, including giving thanks for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. First Nations traditions would include feasting, prayer, dance and other ceremonies. However, the concept of <b>thanksgiving</b> was influenced by our American neighbours.  The origin of <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> isn&rsquo;t completely clear. Indigenous Peoples marked the fall harvest with prayer, dance and potlatch thousands of years before colonial settlers celebrated.  The first large, national Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>in</b> <b>1859</b> in what was then called the province of Canada. The province of Canada was developed when Upper Canada and Lower Canada were united by Britain in 1841.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or Thanksgiving Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  Though Canada does have a first Thanksgiving story analogous to the U.S. story of the feast at Plymouth in <b>1621</b> &mdash; it involves the pirate/explorer Martin Frobisher giving thanks in 1578 for a safe...  The first official, annual Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>, though Indigenous peoples in Canada have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers. </p>        <p>Where to go out for thanksgiving dinner.
