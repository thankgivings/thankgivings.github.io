        <h2><strong>What is open on thanksgiving in chicago Thanksgiving gift ideas for hostess</strong></h2>
        <p>Since 1957, Canadian Thanksgiving has been celebrated on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b>. This change was made to separate the celebration of the harvest from the Remembrance Day commemorations of Canadian War veterans held in November.  The first official, annual Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>, though Indigenous peoples in Canada have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  What&#39;s the difference between Thanksgiving in America and Thanksgiving in <b>Canada</b>? In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November but in <b>Canada</b>, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus <b>Day</b> in the U.S.).  Today Canadian Thanksgiving is held on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> every year, or at least it has been since Canadian Parliament declared it so on January 31, 1957. Before this, Thanksgiving in Canada had been held sporadically, often coinciding with other major events and anniversaries.  Here is how Canada celebrates their big holiday as well as four ways that the Canadian and U.S. Thanksgivings differ. 1. Canadian Thanksgiving is in <b>October</b>&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian Thanksgiving happens a full month and a half before American Thanksgiving, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  Canadian Thanksgiving is celebrated on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> in <b>October</b> and is an official statutory holiday, except in Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. In Nova Scotia, Thanksgiving is a Designated Retail Closing Day.  Since 1957, Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> has been a holiday in <b>Canada</b> on the second Monday of October. Canadian Thanksgiving is a chance for people to give thanks for fortunes in the past year, including a good harvest. Below, we will explain what people do on Canadian Thanksgiving, as well as the ways that it differs from U.S. Thanksgiving.  Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving on the second <b>Monday</b> in <b>October</b>, while Thanksgiving in the United States is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November. When is Thanksgiving in Canada? In 2025, Thanksgiving in Canada is Monday, October 13.  Thanksgiving Day in Canada has been a holiday <b>on</b> the <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> since 1957. It is a chance for people to give thanks for a good harvest and other fortunes in the past year.
