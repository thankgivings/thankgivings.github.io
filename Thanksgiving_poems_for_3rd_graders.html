        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving poems for 3rd graders Love at the thanksgiving day parade nowvideo</strong></h2>
        <p>Of course the main theme of the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> comes from the name itself, reminding us of the importance of giving thanks. Saying &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; is a primary <b>Jewish</b> value. When a Jew sits down to eat, he or she says: &ldquo;Blessed are you God, for bringing bread from the earth.&rdquo;  Most American Jews regard Thanksgiving as more akin to the Fourth of July than <b>Christmas</b>, devoid of religious associations and offering an opportunity to fully embrace a distinctly American tradition.  If we only take the time to say a few words of thanksgiving to God, whether for bringing the family together or for giving us the food on our plates, we can make Thanksgiving have <b>Jewish</b> meaning.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> may not be an official holiday on the <b>Jewish</b> calendar, but its ideas are as <b>Jewish</b> as ever. First, the very name &quot;Jew&quot; comes from the name &ldquo;Judah,&rdquo; which is related to the Hebrew word for giving thanks - &quot; todah.&rdquo; So our very name as Jews means to give thanks.  1) Thanksgiving is a <b>secular</b> holiday with secular origins; 2) While some people celebrate Thanksgiving with religious rituals, the vast majority of Americans do not; 3) Halakhah permits one to celebrate secular holidays, so long as one avoids doing so with people who celebrate them through religious worship; and  Did you know that <b>Thanksgiving</b> is really a <b>Jewish</b> holiday? Although <b>Thanksgiving</b> is not on the <b>Jewish</b> calendar, historians believe that Sukkot may have inspired America&rsquo;s favorite farewell...  Though all prayers may be discontinued, the prayer for thanksgiving will never cease. (Vayikra Rabbah) The sacrifice or offering of well-being known as sh&#39;lamim, meaning &quot;wholeness&quot; and/or &quot;peace,&quot; is first mentioned in <b>Leviticus</b> <b>3:1</b>, in the first parashah of the Book of Leviticus.  Chanukah was declared a <b>Jewish </b>national holiday 2178 years ago. <b>Thanksgiving </b>was declared a national American holiday on the last Thursday of every November by Abraham Lincoln in 1863. Before then, <b>Thanksgiving </b>was celebrated on different dates in different states, so we won&rsquo;t count those.  Yet, if you&rsquo;re looking for a Jewish thanksgiving, <b>it</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> <b>Sukkot</b> &mdash;<b>which</b> is the last Jewish holiday before Thanksgiving. Sukkot is the original biblical Thanksgiving. The Torah calls it The Festival of Ingathering &mdash;in other words, when all the crops, fruits included, have been gathered in. </p>        <p>Happies thanksgiving.
