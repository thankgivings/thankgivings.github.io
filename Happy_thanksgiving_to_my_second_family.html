        <h2><strong>Happy thanksgiving to my second family Thanksgiving dinner in milford ct</strong></h2>
        <p>What did the pilgrims eat in the first Thanksgiving? **The Pilgrims feasted on a variety of foods during the first Thanksgiving, <b>including</b> <b>venison</b>, <b>wild</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>waterfowl</b>, <b>fish</b>, <b>corn</b>, <b>wheat</b>, <b>barley</b>, <b>peas</b>, <b>beans</b>, <b>onions</b>, <b>radishes</b>, <b>carrots</b>, <b>turnips</b>, <b>pumpkins</b>, and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b>.**  These two sources contain all we know firsthand about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>food</b>. The rest of the menu we can only piece together, based upon what was available, what both groups ate in times of celebration, and what the Native Americans would have (literally) brought to the table.  So, to the question &ldquo;What did the Pilgrims eat for Thanksgiving,&rdquo; the answer is both surprising and <b>expected</b>. <b>Turkey</b> (<b>probably</b>), <b>venison</b>, <b>seafood</b>, and all of the vegetables that they had planted and harvested that <b>year</b>&mdash;<b>onions</b>, <b>carrots</b>, <b>beans</b>, <b>spinach</b>, <b>lettuce</b>, and other greens.  Today, the traditional Thanksgiving dinner includes any number of <b>dishes</b>: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, candied yams, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie.  So what <b>foods</b> were served <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  While Winslow doesn&#39;t mention root vegetables in his letter about the harvest celebration, they may have been some of the <b>foods</b> eaten at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Plimoth Patuxet Museum notes that the Pilgrims grew carrots and turnips in their gardens.  When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the <b>Pilgrims</b> did <b>eat</b> turkey in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  Have you ever wondered what the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>ate</b> <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  For most people, <b>enjoying</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, <b>apple</b> pie. But how did the Pilgrims... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving wishes examples. Vegan restaurants nyc open thanksgiving. <b>Happy thanksgiving to my second family</b>. Full on thanksgiving lol.
