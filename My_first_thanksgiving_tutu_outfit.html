        <h2><strong>My first thanksgiving tutu outfit What president moved thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>The first and most significant issue in discussing whether it is halachic [acceptable according to <b>Jewish</b> law] to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> is whether it is permissible to eat a <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal, with the classical foods that American tradition indicates one should eat at this meal: turkey and cranberry sauce. Among the authorities of the ...  While we typically don&rsquo;t think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a particularly Jewish day, it has the potential to be the most Jewish of all the secular holidays. With its focus on gathering as a community, giving thanks, and being mindful, Thanksgiving is infused with central Jewish values.  Among haredi Orthodox Jews, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is not widely observed. The Agudath Israel of America, the leading haredi umbrella organization, routinely schedules its annual convention to begin on <b>Thanksgiving</b> day &mdash; perhaps because its members are less likely to have to work that day.  Chanukah was declared a <b>Jewish</b> national holiday 2178 years ago. <b>Thanksgiving</b> was declared a national American holiday on the last Thursday of every November by Abraham Lincoln in 1863. Before then, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was celebrated on different dates in different states, so we won&rsquo;t count those.  If we only take the time to say a few words of <b>thanksgiving</b> to God, whether for bringing the family together or for giving us the food on our plates, we can make <b>Thanksgiving</b> have <b>Jewish</b> meaning. 1. READ BEFORE THE MEAL BEGINS.  Not only is it very possible to bring Judaism into Thanksgiving, in fact Thanksgiving very likely has its origins in the Jewish holiday of <b>Sukkot</b>.  Judaism both widens and focuses our perspective. Our Sages teach us to <b>recite</b> one hundred blessings a day (see Babylonian Talmud, M&#39;nachot 43b). Rabbi Kelman teaches us about this liturgical pillar of hodaya, thanksgiving.  By drawing on Jewish values of hospitality and justice, we can view <b>Thanksgiving</b> as more than a day of feasting&mdash;it becomes a sacred opportunity to reconnect, express gratitude, and honor our shared responsibility to each other.  Did you know that <b>Thanksgiving</b> is really a <b>Jewish</b> holiday? Although <b>Thanksgiving</b> is not on the <b>Jewish</b> calendar, historians believe that Sukkot may have inspired America&rsquo;s favorite farewell... </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/14.html">Atlantis thanksgiving buffet</a>.
