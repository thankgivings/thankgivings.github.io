        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  National <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> observances are largely filled with myths and misinformation. Popular American folklore suggests the &ldquo;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; was an idyllic feast. This myth, which ignores the fact that the feast was never repeated and that <b>Thanksgiving</b> is an invented holiday, runs contrary to many realities.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> is a day for people in the US to give thanks for what they have. Families and friends get together for a meal, which traditionally includes a roast turkey, stuffing, potatoes, vegetables, cranberry sauce, gravy, and pumpkin pie.  America&rsquo;s Thanksgiving holiday, born in the 1500s, mythologized in 1621, and observed even during the bleakest hours of the Civil War, now stands as one of the nation&rsquo;s most anticipated and beloved days &mdash; celebrated each year on the fourth Thursday in November (<b>November</b> <b>28</b>, <b>2024</b>). Perhaps no other nonsectarian holiday has more tradition.  Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in <b>October</b> and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  Thanksgiving Eve (also known as <b>Blackout</b> <b>Wednesday</b>), the night before Thanksgiving, is one of the busiest nights of the year for bars and clubs as many college students and others return to their hometowns to reunite with friends and family. [140]  In 2024, Thanksgiving will be observed on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>28</b>. Thanksgiving has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year. The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is November 22; the latest is November 28.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, November 28.
