        <h2><strong>My family does nothing on thanksgiving Akc dog show thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>There are only six ingredients in this <b>stuffing</b> recipe, plus salt and pepper. What makes this traditional stuffing so crave-worthy is the trifecta of onions and celery saut&eacute;ed in more butter than you think you should use.  This <b>homemade</b> <b>stuffing</b> is the easy, classic recipe you should reach for if you&#39;re looking to perfect the staple <b>Thanksgiving</b> side.  For <b>stuffing</b> to be safe to eat, it needs to reach an internal temperature of 165&deg;F, the same as your <b>turkey</b>. However, in order for the <b>stuffing</b> to reach that temperature, the surrounding <b>turkey</b> meat may need to be cooked to 180&deg;F or higher. This results in overcooked, dry <b>turkey</b>, and nobody wants that!  When it comes to <b>Thanksgiving</b> sides, our turkey <b>stuffing</b> is always on the must-make list. Whether you call it <b>stuffing</b> or dressing, this traditional <b>stuffing</b> recipe is a crowd-pleasing classic for holiday gatherings, boasting the perfect blend of herbs, pillowy soft bread, butter, and fresh veggies.  This classic Thanksgiving stuffing is easy and straightforward to make, even if you&rsquo;ve never made <b>homemade</b> stuffing before. Here&rsquo;s a quick overview of the <b>recipe</b>: <b>Melt</b> <b>the</b> <b>butter</b> in <b>a</b> <b>skillet</b>, then saut&eacute; the onion and celery until softened.  It&rsquo;s a simple but perfect <b>from</b>-<b>scratch</b> recipe that can be prepped ahead and baked while the turkey finishes. The flavor is quintessentially Thanksgiving. With butter, fresh herbs, and saut&eacute;ed onions, celery, and garlic, you&rsquo;ll want a bit of this classic stuffing with every bite of turkey and gravy. You can make it in advance.  Celery and onions are cooked with butter, herbs and seasonings. It&rsquo;s all tossed with dried bread cubes and broth, then topped with a bit more butter and baked until hot and golden. I love mashed potatoes, but <b>homemade</b> <b>stuffing</b> is easily my favorite thanksgiving side dish.  This Classic <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Stuffing</b> recipe has withstood the test of time. It has the perfect balance of chewy and moist, sweet and savory, and can be made entirely <b>from</b> <b>scratch</b> or with some simple shortcuts. I&#39;ll show you the best <b>homemade</b> <b>stuffing</b> recipe for your holiday meal.  This turkey <b>stuffing</b> recipe made with bread, celery, onions, and broth is flavored with garlic and herbs for the perfect <b>Thanksgiving</b> side for turkey. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving song parody jimmy fallon.
