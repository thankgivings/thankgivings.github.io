        <p>History of eating <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> in the middle of the day, why the Pilgrims did it, and why you should schedule yours at dinnertime.  So why do we keep making (and <b>eating</b>) this stuff? While it&rsquo;s likely that the 1621 feast between European colonists and native Wampanoag that we associate with the &ldquo; first <b>Thanksgiving</b> &rdquo; did occur, the origins of the traditions we continue to uphold (specifically, the menu) aren&rsquo;t so crystalline.

The least popular time to <b>eat</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> is after 6 p.m. Of the poll respondents, only 9 percent (3,152) believe you should <b>eat</b> this meal late in the evening. On the other hand, <b>eating</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> too <b>early</b> is also a no-no, according to our poll results.
