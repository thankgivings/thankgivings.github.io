        <h2><strong>Kjv week before thanksgiving Chesapeake restaurants open thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>What Was on the Menu at the First Thanksgiving? Traditional Thanksgiving dinner includes <b>turkey</b>, stuffing and mashed potatoes but the First Thanksgiving likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge...  Although their exact <b>menu</b> has been lost to us, Wampanoag oral history, plus a few Costco receipts left by <b>Pilgrims</b>, suggest that corn, beans, and squash were central to that feast. In the spring of 1621, the Wampanoags, who were largely an agrarian people , gave the <b>Pilgrims</b> crop seeds, as well as a tutorial (possibly an App; we can&rsquo;t be sure ...  Since the historic meal in 1621, <b>Thanksgiving</b> traditions have changed and evolved with American culture. From turkey and stuffing to potatoes and pies, we know what dishes to expect at our holiday tables today, but you might be surprised to learn what foods the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag brought to the table and what didn&rsquo;t make the cut.  Have you ever wondered what the <b>Pilgrims</b> ate at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  See what was really on the <b>menu</b>! For most Americans, the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Thanksgiving feast <b>includes</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> <b>casserole</b>, <b>pumpkin</b> pie, and green bean <b>casserole</b>. The whole meal may last an hour or two.  For the <b>Pilgrims</b>, this was not a holy day of thanksgiving, a long and solemn day of prayer, preaching, and worship. Instead, the &ldquo;first&rdquo; thanksgiving <b>was</b> a harvest celebration, including military drills and &ldquo;recreations&rdquo; (probably races, shooting contests, and so forth).  This <b>original</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>menu</b> comes from Plimouth Plantation, a historical village dedicated to telling the true history of America&#39;s earliest settlers.  These two sources contain all we know firsthand about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> food. The rest of the <b>menu</b> we can only piece together, based upon what was available, what both groups ate in times of celebration, and what the Native Americans would have (literally) brought to the table.  Turkey, corn, and pumpkin pie are all <b>Thanksgiving</b> staples, but what did the <b>pilgrims</b> actually eat at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>?
