        <h2><strong>What not to feed your dog on thanksgiving Foods in thanksgiving day</strong></h2>
        <p>From then on, when they celebrated Thanksgiving, the Pilgrims laid out five kernels of <b>corn</b> on each plate to remind themselves of their blessings. Let us remember: The first kernel reminds us of the autumn beauty all around us. The second kernel reminds us of our love for one another. The third kernel reminds us of God&rsquo;s love and care for us.  This Thanksgiving, start a new family tradition...5 Kernels of <b>Corn</b>. Free Printable included! Add an educational element to Thanksgiving!  The five kernels of <b>corn</b> help us to remember five things for which we are thankful. The first kernel reminds us that God loves us. The second kernel reminds us that God provides for all our needs.  Oftentimes, at our family&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day celebrations, guests will find <b>5</b> kernels of <b>corn</b> beside their plate. And at some point during the meal, we all take turns naming five things for which we&rsquo;re thankful that year &mdash; one for each kernel .  Many people follow a tradition of placing five kernels of <b>corn</b> on the empty plate at each place on the Thanksgiving dinner table. These five kernels of corn serve as a reminder of days when food was scarce and how God provides for our needs.  The story goes that once <b>Thanksgiving </b>became a holiday, the Pilgrims would start their meal with five kernels <b>of corn </b>on their plate. These five golden kernels represented all the pilgrims had to eat for the entire day during difficult winter.  For generations New Englanders, and some Mayflower families that moved south and west, practiced a quaint little tradition at their Thanksgiving table. Each place setting was given five kernels of parched <b>corn</b>, often along with a card that had this little poem, or a similar one: Five Kernels. The first winter in Plymouth was very cold.  In our home, we set out five kernels of <b>corn</b> at each place around the table, sharing the story passed down through generations. These five simple kernels have grown to become a cherished part of our Thanksgiving tradition in our home.  This Thanksgiving with your Happy Home, consider placing <b>5</b> kernels of corn (corn, popcorn seeds, candy corn, etc.) at each guest&rsquo;s place setting. Spend a few minutes before the meal going around the table and having everyone share 5 things that they are thankful for &ndash; a reminder of those 5 kernels of corn. </p>        <p>Different thanksgiving traditions in america. <a href="./124.html">Thanksgiving letter for meeting</a>.
