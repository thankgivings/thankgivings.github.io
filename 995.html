        <h2><strong>Is the first thanksgiving a myth How bad is traffic going through nyc on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>This is where the traditional telling of the Pilgrims and the <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>myth</b> ends, with the two groups sitting down to dinner, celebrating their partnership and, for the Pilgrims, celebrating ...  <b>Myth</b>: The Pilgrims were the <b>first</b> Europeans to land in Southern New England and to interact with the Native people. ... the feast that would serve as the basis of the traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>myth</b> ...  As <b>historian</b> <b>David</b> <b>J</b>. <b>Silverman</b> points out, the myth of the first Thanksgiving has been stripped of its political realities, propagating the misperception that Native Americans just willingly gave up their land to the colonists.  &quot;The <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>myth</b> that many Americans have been brought up with would have us believe that the English were lucky enough to stumble upon friendly Indians,&quot; Silverman said.  Popular American folklore suggests the &ldquo;first Thanksgiving&rdquo; was <b>an</b> <b>idyllic</b> <b>feast</b>. This myth, which ignores the fact that the feast was never repeated and that Thanksgiving is an invented holiday, runs contrary to many realities.  Jean Leon Gerome Ferris&rsquo;s 1912 painting, &ldquo;The <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, 1621,&rdquo; is wrong in almost every respect, as author Karla K. Bruno writes.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many <b>myths</b> surround the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  The myth <b>of</b> the first Thanksgiving refers to the mythologized retelling of <b>a</b> <b>1621</b> harvest feast by the Puritans in Plymouth, Massachusetts as the foundation for the modern Thanksgiving holiday as celebrated in the United States.  A prevalent opposing viewpoint is that the first Thanksgiving stemmed from the massacre <b>of</b> <b>Pequot</b> people in <b>1637</b>, a culmination of the Pequot War. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving pictures free.
