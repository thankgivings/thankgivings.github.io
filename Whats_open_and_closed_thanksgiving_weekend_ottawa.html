        <p>What does the Thanksgiving holiday <b>celebrate</b>? Learn about the first encounter between the Pilgrims and Native Americans in 1621, their surprising relationship, and the reason a United States ...  In Fall <b>1621</b>, the Pilgrims held a public day of Thanksgiving to God for His provision and blessings, celebrating their harvest with a feast.  Editor&#39;s Note: This story <b>first</b> published in 2020. The traditional story of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, and by extension <b>the Pilgrims</b> &mdash; the one repeated in school history books and given the Peanuts treatment in &quot;A Charlie Brown <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; &mdash; doesn&rsquo;t start in 1620, with the cold and seasick <b>Pilgrims</b> stepping off the Mayflower onto Plymouth Rock.  While <b>the Pilgrim&#39;s</b> story <b>did</b> not itself create the modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday, it <b>did</b> become inextricably linked with it in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This was largely due to the introduction in U.S. schools of &quot;an annual sequence of classroom holiday activities through which civic education and American patriotism were ...  The modern <b>celebration</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is not how it once was. Take a look at what <b>Pilgrims</b> ate and wore during the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall <b>of</b> 1621.  Pilgrims held their second Thanksgiving celebration in <b>1623</b> to mark the end of a long drought that had threatened the year&rsquo;s harvest and prompted Governor Bradford to call for a religious fast.  In November 1621, after a year of hard work, <b>the Pilgrims</b> had their <b>first</b> successful corn harvest. They were so grateful for their bountiful harvest that they decided to have a big feast to give thanks. <b>The Pilgrims</b> invited Squanto and the Wampanoags to join them in this feast as thanks for their help.  <b>The first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by <b>the pilgrims</b> of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround <b>the first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written. </p>        <p>Recipes for leftover ham from thanksgiving.
