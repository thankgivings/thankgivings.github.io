        <p>&ldquo;Friday-after-Thanksgiving-itis&rdquo; is a <b>disease</b> second only to the <b>bubonic</b> <b>plague</b> in its effects. At least that&rsquo;s the feeling of those who have to get production out, when the &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; comes along. The shop may be half empty, but every absentee was sick â€• and can prove it.  Black Friday&#39;s name dates back to <b>the</b> <b>1950s</b>, the History Channel reports. It was used by Philadelphia police to describe the chaos that often took place in the city the day after Thanksgiving.  Many people believe we call the day after Thanksgiving &quot;Black Friday&quot; because <b>stores</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>or</b> <b>being</b> &quot;<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>red</b>,&quot; <b>to</b> <b>earning</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b>...  Why is it called <b>Black</b> <b>Friday</b>? Everything to know about when it became a thing the day after Thanksgiving, including its origins and best deals.  <b>Black</b> <b>Friday</b> is a name used for two unrelated occasions. It is now most popularly used in the US to refer to the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which is often considered the first <b>day</b> of the holiday shopping season and is known for featuring discounts from retailers.  It is believed by many that the term <b>Black</b> <b>Friday</b> derives from the concept that businesses operate at a financial loss, or are &ldquo;in the red,&rdquo; until the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, when massive sales finally allow them to turn a profit, or put them &ldquo;in the <b>black</b>.&rdquo; However, this is untrue.  Back in the 1950s, police in the city of Philadelphia used the term to describe the chaos that ensued on the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, when hordes of suburban shoppers and tourists flooded into...  The term &ldquo;Black Friday,&rdquo; in reference to the day after Thanksgiving, can be traced to the city of Philadelphia in the 1950s. The city&rsquo;s police officers called the day Black Friday because of <b>the</b> chaos created by the descent of enormous crowds of shoppers in the downtown area.  <b>Black</b> <b>Friday</b> is the <b>Friday</b> <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in the United States. It traditionally marks the start of the Christmas shopping season and is the busiest shopping <b>day</b> of the year in the United States. </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/497.html">Thanksgiving hallmark movies on youtube</a>.
