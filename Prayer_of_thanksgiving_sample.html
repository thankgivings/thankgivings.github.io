The legendary HAROLD &quot;RED&quot; GRANGE (left) made his pro debut for the Chicago Bears on Thanksgiving <b>1925</b>.  According to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the first Thanksgiving football games were held on <b>Nov</b>. <b>25</b>, <b>1920</b>. Six games were supposedly played that day, and an urban legend states that the Chicago Tigers and Decatur Staleys challenged each other to a Thanksgiving duel in Chicago in the league&rsquo;s inaugural season.  The key <b>game</b> in the title drive came on Thanksgiving <b>Day</b>, when the Lions defeated the Bears 14-2 to clinch the West championship.

Thanksgiving football dates to at <b>least</b> <b>1876</b>, when Yale defeated Princeton, 2-0, on a cold, bleak afternoon in Hoboken, New Jersey. By the 1890s, many college and high school teams played on...  With the exception of 1939-44 during World War II, the Lions have hosted a Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> <b>game</b> every year since 1934. The first nationally televised <b>game</b> was in 1953, when the Lions...  As the late, great John Madden put it, &ldquo;Thanksgiving and <b>football</b>. Some things just go together greatly.&rdquo; While it may seem like the <b>NFL</b> and Thanksgiving have always gone together, that&rsquo;s not exactly the case. The <b>NFL</b> began in 1920, but the first Thanksgiving <b>game</b> didn&rsquo;t occur until 14 years later. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving baked mac and cheese. Thanksgiving history origin.
