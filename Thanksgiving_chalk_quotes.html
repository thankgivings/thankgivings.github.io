        <p><b>What Did</b> the Pilgrims <b>Eat</b> on the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Many dishes served during modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> meals were not present <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have potatoes, nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> have butter or flour necessary for making pies. The pilgrims hadn&rsquo;t even built their <b>first</b> oven by the time of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  The Wampanoag of <b>1621</b> harvested chestnuts, walnuts and beechnuts from the local forests, and <b>they</b> grew beans, squashes and pumpkins in addition to flint corn. Coming from the Wampanoag word ms&iacute;ckquatash , historians agree that succotash &mdash; a hearty dish made from beans, corn and squash&mdash; was likely served at the historic meal.  All the things the <b>first</b> Pilgrims and the native Wampanoag ate back in the year <b>1621</b>, right? Of course, we know that isn&rsquo;t exactly accurate. For one thing, macaroni and cheese is definitely not a traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> food, nor <b>did</b> the Pilgrims and Wampanoag have oven-safe dishes for baking green-bean casseroles.  What <b>They</b> (Likely) <b>Did</b> Have <b>at</b> the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Venison; Fowl (geese and duck) Corn; Nuts (walnuts, chestnuts, beechnuts) Shellfish; So venison was a major ingredient, as well as fowl, but that likely included geese and ducks. Turkeys are a possibility, but were not a common food in that time. Pilgrims grew onions and herbs.  Pilgrims&rsquo; <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Recipes. If you&rsquo;re looking to make history with this year&rsquo;s holiday meal, these recipes based on foods from the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> may give you the opportunity to do just that. While clearly not replicating recipes and procedures of the era, <b>they</b> are delicious just the same! Pumpkin Shell Custard. Ingredients:  The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. <b>They</b> played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the <b>1621</b> harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623.  Historical Records About Foods <b>at</b> the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. In a letter dated December 11, <b>1621</b>, Mayflower passenger Edward Winslow offers some of the only historical information about what <b>they</b> ate <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. After noting that the colonists had harvested a good crop &quot;Indian corn&quot; and an acceptable crop of barley but lost their ...  The geographical landscape of Plymouth (or Plimoth Plantation as the settlers called it <b>in 1621</b>), was a direct link to the foods that were eaten <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Plymouth&#39;s coastal location overlooking Cape Cod Bay offered a multitude of shellfish to those who inhabited the area.  William Bradford, the governor Winslow mentions, also described the autumn of <b>1621</b>, adding, &ldquo;And besides waterfowl there was great store of wild turkeys, of which <b>they</b> took many, besides venison ... </p>        <p>The grinch stole christmas trump stole thanksgiving.
