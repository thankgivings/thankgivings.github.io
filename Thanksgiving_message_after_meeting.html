        <p>While there is no documentation on exactly when that First Thanksgiving was held, experts at Plimoth Plantation believe it would have occurred sometime between September 21 and November 11. Two colonists gave personal <b>accounts</b> of the 1621 feast in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  The Pilgrims&#39; first corn harvest was successful and in November the group&#39;s leader, Governor William <b>Bradford</b>, called for a feast to celebrate their good fortune. Hunters were sent into the wilderness to hunt game for the event.  The man to step forward in Plymouth colony <b>was</b> William Bradford. After the first governor elected under the Mayflower Compact perished from the harsh winter, Bradford was elected governor for the next thirty years.  Associated Locations: Plymouth, Massachusets Associated Dates: November 29, 1623 &ndash; date given Inasmuch as the great Father has given us this year an abundant harvest of Indian corn, wheat, peas, beans, squashes, and garden vegetables, and has made the forests to abound with game and the sea with fish and clams, and inasmuch as he [&hellip;]  William <b>Bradford</b>.

The selection transcribed in this article is an excerpt from William <b>Bradford</b>&rsquo;s Of Plymouth Plantation, which is his <b>account </b>of the settlement of Plymouth Colony from 1620 to 1647. William was born to William and Alice Hanson <b>Bradford </b>in Austerfield, Yorkshire, England, early in 1590.  The first <b>account</b> is William Bradford&rsquo;s journal titled Of Plymouth Plantation and the other is a publication written by Edward Winslow titled Mourt&rsquo;s Relations. What is known is that the pilgrims held the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast to celebrate the successful fall harvest.  William Bradford played an important role in starting the tradition of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, but what was that role specifically? We will look at who he was even before leaving Europe, how he rose to be governor, and how he helped arrange the first Thanksgiving.  William <b>Bradford</b>, Plymouth&rsquo;s governor in 1621, wrote briefly of the event in Of Plymouth Plantation, his history of the colony, but that was more than 20 years after the feast itself.
