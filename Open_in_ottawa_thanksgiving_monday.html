        <p>Eager to learn more about <b>Thanksgiving</b> In <b>Germany</b>? Then read on to know everything about one of the most fascinating harvest festivals in the world! Erntedankfest (&ldquo;give thanks for the harvest festival&ldquo;), is an annual celebration that happens around the time of the main harvest of a given region.  President Lincoln declared a national Day of Thanksgiving <b>on</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1863</b>. But it was a one-time event, and future Thanksgiving observances were based on the whims of various presidents until President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill creating the current holiday in 1941.  The modern celebration of Thanksgiving in Germany has its roots in the early <b>17th</b> century, when Protestant refugees from Salzburg, Austria, settled in the town of Berchtesgaden in Bavaria. These refugees brought with them the tradition of celebrating a harvest festival, which eventually evolved into the modern-day Thanksgiving.  In Germany, Thanksgiving&mdash; (&ldquo;das Erntedankfest,&rdquo; i.e.,Thanksgiving Harvest Festival)&mdash;is strongly entrenched in German culture. Erntedankfest is usually observed on the first <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> (<b>04</b> <b>October</b> <b>2015</b> this year), although the timing is not hard and fast nationwide.  Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and <b>November</b> in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  The &ldquo;First Thanksgiving&rdquo; took place <b>in</b> <b>1621</b> between the Puritan pilgrims at Plymouth and the Wampanoag tribe. This celebration was to celebrate the Pilgrims&rsquo; first successful harvest and to thank the neighboring Wampanoag tribe.  Thanksgiving in America may be a tradition dating back to the <b>17th</b> <b>century</b>, but in Germany and the rest of Europe, harvest celebrations have been a fixture since pagan times. We take a look at the Erntedank harvest festival and explain why it&rsquo;s sometimes considered the &ldquo;Thanksgiving of Germany&rdquo;.  In its earlier forms, was a predominantly rural ritual usually celebrated on the autumnal equinox <b>in</b> <b>September</b>. Over time, German Thanksgiving evolved into a Christian tradition closely associated with the Church, and it remains so today. What happens on German Thanksgiving Day?  Each year, the Harvest Festival takes place on the first Sunday <b>of</b> <b>October</b>, and very often right after the German grape harvest festival (better known as Oktoberfest).
