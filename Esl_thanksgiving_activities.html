        <p>Learn about Chuseok, or Hangawi, the Korean <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday. Find out when Chuseok is in 2024, why it&#39;s celebrated, Chuseok traditions, <b>history</b>, and more.  Chuseok (추석), also known as Hangawi, marks a zenith in the Korean calendar, rivaling only the lunar New Year in its cultural significance. Often likened to Thanksgiving, this festival is observed on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, typically aligning with September or October by the Gregorian reckoning.  Chuseok is one of South <b>Korea</b>&rsquo;s most important and cherished traditional holidays. It is also known as Hangawi and is similar to the United States <b>Thanksgiving</b>. During this time, families gather together to experience warmth and gratitude.  Chuseok (추석) &ndash; otherwise known as Hangawi (한가위) by Koreans or as &ldquo;Korean Thanksgiving&rdquo; by Westerners &ndash; is one of the most significant public holidays in Korea, together with Seollal or the Korean New Year (설날).  Chuseok, also known as Korean <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, is one of the most important and festive holidays of the year. This year, Chuseok falls on Thursday, September 19th, but the holiday period actually lasts for three days in total &ndash; including the day before and after Chuseok.  Chusok, <b>Korea</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> annual <b>thanksgiving</b> holiday, is one of the biggest migration events in modern Korea. Over half of the population visits families and ancestral graves during the three-day holiday, which usually falls sometime in September or October.  Chuseok is commonly incorrectly translated as &quot;Korean <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; in American English despite the holidays being vastly different in origin and celebration. [8][9] Although most South Koreans visit their families and ancestral homes, there are festivities held at the National Folk Museum of <b>Korea</b>.  Chuseok has a long and storied <b>history</b> dating back over two millennia. Its origins can be traced to Gabae, a weaving contest during the Shilla Kingdom period. Over time, Chuseok evolved into a more agrarian celebration, focusing on giving thanks for a successful harvest.
