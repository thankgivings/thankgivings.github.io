        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving thanks for family Map of thanksgiving side dishes</strong></h2>
        <p>How long was the first Thanksgiving <b>dinner</b>? It wasn&#39;t just a dinner. It lasted three days. Who was there? About fifty Pilgrims came. Plus 90 Wampanoag Indians.  What did they eat at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, and how similar is it to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal today? Here&rsquo;s how Edward Winslow described the first Thanksgiving feast in a letter to a friend:  From <b>seafood</b> to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  Traditional Thanksgiving dinner includes <b>turkey</b>, stuffing and mashed <b>potatoes</b> but the First Thanksgiving likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge and venison. Bettmann / Corbis  For most people, <b>enjoying</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, apple pie. But how did the Pilgrims really...  So what foods were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  So which foods were actually eaten during the first Thanksgiving? According to Smithsonian Magazine, there are two surviving documents which state that <b>deer</b>, <b>wildfowl</b>, and <b>corn</b> (in the form of cornbread and porridge) were eaten. Read on for more fun facts about the history of Thanksgiving food.  There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest meal. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn bread and porridge.  Turkey, corn, and pumpkin pie are all Thanksgiving staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? The answer might surprise you! </p>        <p>Thanksgiving 280zx.
