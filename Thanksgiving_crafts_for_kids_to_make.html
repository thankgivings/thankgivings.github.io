        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving crafts for kids to make Happy thanksgiving christian pictures</strong></h2>
        <p>In 1940 and 1941, FDR <b>celebrated</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the second to last Thursdays in November, while some opponents continued to <b>celebrate</b> it on the last Thursday. To end this confusion and to unify the country as the United States entered World War II, the House and Senate passed a resolution establishing <b>Thanksgiving</b> as the fourth Thursday in ...  This 1623 festival appears to have been the origin of our Thanksgiving Day because <b>it</b> <b>combined</b> a <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>celebration</b>. Festivals of Thanksgiving were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years.  This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such in 1863.  <b>Why</b> is <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the fourth Thursday in November? (In 2024, it&#39;s the LATEST this holiday can be held). What were the real reasons both Washington and Lincoln proclaimed a day of <b>Thanksgiving</b>? (No, it&#39;s not about a Pilgrim feast.) Get the facts.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a national holiday <b>celebrated</b> on various dates in October and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  &quot;We <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> along with the rest of America, maybe in different ways and for different reasons. Despite everything that&#39;s happened to us since we fed the Pilgrims, we still have our language, our culture, our distinct social system. Even in a nuclear age, we still have a tribal people.&quot;  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving is </b>generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast <b>celebrated </b>by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  Thanksgiving is a U.S. holiday <b>celebrated</b> each year at the end of November.
