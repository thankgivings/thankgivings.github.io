        <h2><strong>Restaurants in fairfield county serving thanksgiving dinner Thanksgiving free giveaways</strong></h2>
        <p>&lsquo;Ernte&rsquo; means <b>harvest</b>, while &lsquo;Dank&rsquo; comes from &lsquo;Danke&rsquo;, meaning thank you, and &lsquo;Fest&rsquo; is <b>German</b> for festival or celebration. The word Erntedankfest therefore translates to &lsquo;<b>Harvest</b> thank festival&rsquo;. So Erntedankfest is a <b>harvest</b> festival where you express thanks for the food you have received throughout the year!  A typical <b>German</b> church observance of Erntedankfest begins with a sermon and a choir singing songs of thanks. Following this comes the <b>thanksgiving</b> procession, complete with the presenting of the traditional &ldquo;<b>harvest</b> crown&rdquo; (Erntekrone) to the <b>harvest</b> queen (Erntek&ouml;nigin). Later in the day there is more music, dancing, and food.  A <b>Thanksgiving</b> procession is held at 2:00 pm and concludes with the presenting of the traditional &quot;<b>harvest</b> crown&quot; (Erntekrone). At 3:00 pm, there&#39;s music (&quot;von Blasmusik bis Jazz&quot;), dancing, and food inside and outside the church.  A history of <b>German</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.

The alter is decorated with sheaves of wheat, and the fruits of the <b>harvest</b>.
