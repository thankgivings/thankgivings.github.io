From cooking stress to tense conversations to full-on blowouts, many situations can derail a <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner. But there are ways to keep <b>things</b> peaceful and light, as well. We asked etiquette experts to share some common rude behaviors at big holiday gatherings like <b>Thanksgiving</b>, and advice for avoiding them.

Some dishes may not be your favorites at the <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner table or you may prefer a dish prepared a different way. But complaining about the food isn&rsquo;t the way to go. &ldquo;Openly criticizing or belittling the food or the host&rsquo;s effort is inconsiderate because <b>Thanksgiving</b> is about gratitude and unity,&rdquo; says Musayeva. </p>        <p>Macys thanksgiving day parade floats inflated.
