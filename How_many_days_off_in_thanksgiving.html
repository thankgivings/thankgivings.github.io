        <h2><strong>How many days off in thanksgiving Turkey cupcakes for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Though usually a regional event and often times a religious celebration, <b>Germany</b>&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving </b>(Erntedankfest) is a colorful festivity with parades, farmer&rsquo;s markets, live music, traditional costumes, activities for kids and much more.  In <b>Germany</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b>&mdash; (&ldquo;das Erntedankfest,&rdquo; i.e.,<b>Thanksgiving </b>Harvest Festival)&mdash;is strongly entrenched in German culture. Erntedankfest is usually observed on the first Sunday of October (04 October 2015 this year), although the timing is not hard and fast nationwide.  Did you know that Thanksgiving is also observed in <b>Germany</b>? Yes! Read on to learn all about Erntedankfest, a harvest festival that you&#39;ll want to experience!  <b>German</b> Thanksgiving, otherwise known as &lsquo;Erntedank,&rsquo; has certain traditions in common with American Thanksgiving. But it is clearly its own holiday.  <b>The</b> <b>Harvest</b> Festival in Germany is similar&mdash;but not identical&mdash;to Thanksgiving in the United States. It&rsquo;s a holiday to celebrate the autumn Ernte (&ldquo;harvest&rdquo;), as well as show appreciation to God and people working in Landwirtschaft (&ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;).  Do Germans celebrate Thanksgiving? Despite the <b>holidays</b> having the same name in English, however, Thanksgiving in <b>Germany</b> is not a big day for family gatherings and feasting - which are typically reserved for Christmas.  Today, the German tradition of Erntedank is mainly a religious <b>holiday</b>. While there are some slight differences in the exact date of Erntedank , celebrations, church services, and parades are usually held the first Sunday of November.  Whether you&rsquo;re an expat living in <b>Germany</b> or simply curious about how Thanksgiving is celebrated in other parts of the world, this post will provide you with a comprehensive overview of how the <b>holiday</b> is observed in <b>Germany</b>.  In German-speaking countries, Erntedankfest is often celebrated on the first Sunday in October, which is usually also the first Sunday following Michaelistag or Michaelmas (29 Sept.), but various locales may give thanks at different times during September and October. </p>        <p>What did the first thanksgiving eat. <a href="./220.html">Walmart thanksgiving 2024 hours goshen in</a>.
