        <p>Here are some of my favorites that I think would complement the <b>traditional</b> turkey <b>dinner</b>. 15 Polish Dishes That Will Complement Your Thanksgiving Dinner. 1. Polish <b>Cabbage</b> and Mushrooms {Kapusta z Grzybami} Every Polish holiday is marked with a cabbage dish.  While we&rsquo;re on the subject of language, the Polish translation for America&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b>, <b>Swięto</b> <b>Dziękczynienia</b>, might also be quite a tongue-twister to many Polish and non-Polish Americans!  Truth be told, Thanksgiving is not a classic <b>Polish</b> tradition. But it is catching on and there is no reason why we can&rsquo;t add a Polish twist to our own feast at home. In fact, after 68 years of traditional Thanksgiving dinners, adding a Polish twist is a pretty attractive idea.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b>. Turkey, yams, pumpkin pie and cranberry sauce are some of the staples, but&hellip; say you want to shake things up a bit and add some Polish <b>flavour</b> <b>to</b> your dinner? Here&rsquo;s some Polish culinary inspiration from Culture.pl!  This year, I&rsquo;m going to incorporate some of my favorite aspects of <b>Polish</b> cuisine into <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b>, and I&rsquo;m going to start by sneaking some of them into the turkey stuffing! If you remember episode #1 of Flavor of Poland, you&rsquo;ll recall I showed how to make a <b>traditional</b> Krakow-style roasted duck.  Search. Cookbooks; <b>Dinner</b>. Beef; Chicken; Fish; Pork; Soups; Veal; Venison; Diet Type. Dairy-Free; Gluten-Free  Even though <b>Thanksgiving</b> is primarily a North American holiday, devotees of <b>Polish</b> cuisine can very easily give the menu a <b>Polish</b> twist. The first way is to chop up a few tablespoons of fresh dill and combine with your favorite crouton or bread stuffing - replacing any other herbs that might compete with the dill.  Bigos (Hunter&#39;s Stew), is <b>traditional</b> <b>Polish</b> dishes, full of flavor of sauerkraut, kiełbasy (sausage) and dry mushrooms it is the most comforting Polish food.  While American Polish Thanksgiving food often includes turkey and stuffing, traditional Polish cuisine celebrates the autumn harvest.
