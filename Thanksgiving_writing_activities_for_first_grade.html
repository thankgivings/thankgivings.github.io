        <p>Here are eight heart-warming paintings that represent what the <b>Thanksgiving </b>is about. We wish you all the happiness and the wonder of the holiday season. Have a great <b>Thanksgiving</b>! 1. Freedom From Want by Norman Rockwell. Norman Rockwell, Freedom From Want, 1943, Norman Rockwell Museum, Stockbridge, MA, USA.  Painted in a deliberately cartoon-like manner, this bustling scene of women preparing a <b>Thanksgiving </b>feast debuted in the midst of the Great Depression, a time when the themes of a national holiday, rural customs, and family life appealed to struggling Americans.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving </b>to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  In today&rsquo;s Masterpiece Story, we are featuring Freedom from Want, created by American painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell. It captures the Idealism held in World War II America and is one of the quintessential portrayals of <b>Thanksgiving </b>in art. Pull up a chair; let&rsquo;s dig in!  Freedom from Want, also known as The <b>Thanksgiving </b>Picture or I&#39;ll Be Home for Christmas, is the third of the Four Freedoms series of four oil paintings by American artist Norman Rockwell. The works were inspired by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s 1941 State of the Union Address, known as Four Freedoms.  Above the entryway to the Chapel of <b>Thanksgiving </b>is &ldquo;The Spirit of <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;The Dove&rdquo;), an engraved window by artist John Hutton. Representing the divine in some religions, the dove is a symbol used throughout history to depict beauty, peace, hope and <b>thanksgiving</b>.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  &lsquo;The First Thanksgiving, 1621&rsquo; was created in c.1915 by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris in Romanticism style.
