        <h2><strong>Cute diy thanksgiving decorations Thanksgiving recipes with cream cheese</strong></h2>
        <p>Most Americans are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North America. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees.  Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal holiday in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] . Outside the <b>United</b> <b>States</b>, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a <b>U</b>.<b>S</b>. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  It took the Civil War&mdash;and with it the perceived need for a gesture to build national unity&mdash;for Lincoln to declare a day of thanksgiving for the U.S. in October <b>1863</b>, to be celebrated the following month. The story of the &ldquo;first Thanksgiving,&rdquo; however, is more complicated than that which is commonly taught in schools.  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall <b>of</b> <b>1621</b>.  Thanksgiving remains a controversial event and critics argue that it glosses over the brutal conflict faced by Native Americans during the <b>early</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>era</b>. Here is a closer look at the history of Thanksgiving as it evolved through American history.  Most of the U.S. aspects of Thanksgiving (such as the turkey) were incorporated when United <b>Empire</b> <b>Loyalists</b> began to flee from the United States during and after the American Revolution and settled in Canada.  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as <b>Spanish</b> and English days of feasting and prayer to become the football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today.
