        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving season scriptures How do you know what day thanksgiving is</strong></h2>
        <p>In <b>1948</b>, The Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Day Parade was nationally broadcasted for the first time on CBS. That was over 20 years after its inception, though it makes sense when you realize cable wasn&#39;t even invented until earlier that year.  The first Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade was held <b>in</b> <b>1924</b>. It was initially known as the Macy&rsquo;s Christmas Parade and was staged to promote holiday sales and welcome Santa to New York. The...  The <b>Parade</b> <b>first</b> took place in 1924, [2]: 9 tying it for the second-oldest <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>parade</b> in the United States with America&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Parade</b> in Detroit (with both parades being four years younger than Philadelphia&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving Day Parade</b>). The three-hour <b>parade</b> is <b>held</b> in Manhattan, ending outside Macy&#39;s Herald Square, and takes ...  On <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1924, a <b>parade</b> set out from 145th Street in New York, and proceeded down the Upper West Side, all the way from Harlem to Midtown. This was the <b>first</b>-ever Macy&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Parade</b>. The New York Times of November 28 described the event: &ldquo;Santa Claus chose <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> this year to come to town.&rdquo;  The first Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, held <b>November</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1924</b>, was called &ldquo;Macy&rsquo;s Christmas Parade&rdquo; and aimed at ginning up demand for Christmas shopping. Macy&rsquo;s held the parade to celebrate the opening of what it called the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Largest Store&rdquo;&mdash;more than 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 square meters) of retail space that ...  Before the glitz and dozens of floats, Macy&#39;s <b>Day Parade </b>had humble beginnings <b>in </b>the <b>1920</b>&#39;s. So what was the <b>first </b>Macy&#39;s <b>Day Parade </b>like? <b>In </b>1924, Macy&#39;s <b>held </b>its <b>first parade </b>but instead of...  Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade Over the Years. The first Macy&#39;s parade debuted in <b>1924</b> with animals from the Central Park Zoo that were replaced by balloons in 1927.  That first parade held on a relatively mild Thanksgiving Day in <b>1924</b>, was extolled as &ldquo;a marathon of mirth&rdquo; in splashy newspaper ads. It was actually more akin to a modest church carnival on...  At 9 a.m. on the sunlit morning <b>of</b> <b>November</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1924</b>, Macy&rsquo;s gave the children of New York a particularly special Thanksgiving treat as a police escort led the start of the parade from the... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving color pages free printable.
