        <p>Indigenous scholars and activists say that the <b>Thanksgiving</b> story ignores a longer past and future for Native Americans. Here is the whole story.

But some historians argue that Florida, not Massachusetts, may have been the <b>true</b> site of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> in North America.
