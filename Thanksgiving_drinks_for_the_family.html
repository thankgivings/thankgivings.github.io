        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving drinks for the family Preparing for macys thanksgiving day parade</strong></h2>
        <p>Enter His gates with thanksgiving The phrase &quot;Enter His gates with thanksgiving&quot; <b>invites</b> <b>believers</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> God with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>gratitude</b>. The Hebrew word for &quot;gates&quot; (שַׁעַר, sha&#39;ar) often refers to the <b>entry</b> points <b>of</b> a <b>city</b> <b>or</b> <b>temple</b>, <b>symbolizing</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> God&#39;s <b>presence</b>.  Enter into His gates with thanksgiving: &ldquo;<b>Publicly</b> <b>worship</b> God; and when ye come to the house of prayer, be thankful that you have such a privilege; and when you enter his courts, praise him for the permission.&rdquo; (Clarke)  What Is the Importance of Entering His Gates with Thanksgiving? The <b>psalmist</b> calls everybody to enter the sanctuary with praise and thanksgiving. He also describes the Lord as good, having mercy that is everlasting, that His truth is unwavering and that stretches from one age to another.  {c} Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with <b>praise</b>: <b>be</b> <b>thankful</b> <b>unto</b> him, and bless his name. (c) He shows that God will not be worshipped, but by those means which he has appointed.  <b>Enter</b> into <b>his</b> <b>gates</b> with <b>thanksgiving</b>, And into <b>his</b> courts with praise: Be thankful unto him, and bless <b>his</b> name (Psalm 100:4 KJV) It is the rare Christian who has not used the words of this verse or at least heard them in a sermon.  Have you ever heard someone ask about the Bible verse, &ldquo;enter His gates with <b>thanksgiving</b>?&rdquo; What are the gates? How can we enter with thanksgiving if life is full of trouble and despair? As Christians, we place our hope in God. Yes, tough times will come.  A common phrase in the book of Psalms is &ldquo;<b>enter</b> <b>His</b> <b>gates</b> with <b>thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; (Psalm 100:4) As <b>we</b> dive deeper into this idea of &ldquo;entering <b>His</b> <b>gates</b>&hellip;&rdquo; let&rsquo;s remember one truth: <b>We</b>...  <b>We</b> <b>enter</b> in through <b>thanksgiving</b> and praise into <b>His</b> presence and thank Him for <b>his</b> gift of salvation, eternal life, and <b>His</b> finished work. There are so many characteristics of God identified in this Psalm that should produce praise in our hearts toward Him.  PROPOSITION: We enter God&rsquo;s gates with thanksgiving because 1) <b>thanksgiving</b> is the only <b>appropriate</b> response for what God has done for us, 2) thanksgiving brings about a change of attitude in our lives, 3) thanksgiving spurs us into action for the welfare and benefit of others. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving prayer or poem.
