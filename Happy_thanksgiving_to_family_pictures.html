        <h2><strong>Happy thanksgiving to family pictures Dfw thanksgiving brunch</strong></h2>
        <p>The first large, national Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated in <b>1859</b> in what was then called the province of Canada. The province of Canada was developed when Upper Canada and Lower Canada were united by Britain in 1841.  When and why has Thanksgiving been observed in Canada? The first national Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated in the Province of Canada in <b>1859</b>.  Unlike American Thanksgiving, Canada&rsquo;s national Thanksgiving date took decades to become standardized and annual. In <b>1957</b>, Canada&rsquo;s parliament set the date as the <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> in <b>October</b>.  <b>On</b> <b>January</b> <b>31</b>, <b>1957</b>, the Canadian Parliament proclaimed: A Day of General Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed &ndash; to be observed on the 2nd Monday in October. English explorer Martin Frobisher hosted the first Canadian Thanksgiving.  First Celebration: The first Canadian Thanksgiving took place in <b>1578</b> when explorer Martin Frobisher and his crew held a ceremony in Frobisher Bay, Nunavut, to give thanks for surviving their perilous journey from England.  It is said that the first annual Canadian Thanksgiving was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>. Sir Martin Frobisher and his crew are credited as the first Europeans to have celebrated a Thanksgiving ceremony in North America, close to Nunavut in 1578.  Today Canadian Thanksgiving is held on the second Monday of <b>October</b> every year, or at least it has been since Canadian Parliament declared it so on January 31, <b>1957</b>. Before this, Thanksgiving in Canada had been held sporadically, often coinciding with other major events and anniversaries.  The first Thanksgiving in Canada has been credited to English explorer Martin Frobisher. According to historical records, he celebrated in 1578 in what we now know as Newfoundland. The first official Thanksgiving was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>Nov</b>. <b>6</b>, <b>1879</b>.  The first Thanksgiving after the Canadian Confederation didn&rsquo;t happen <b>until</b> <b>April</b> <b>1872</b>, when the holiday was observed to celebrate the recovery of the Prince of Wales from a severe illness. Today, the tradition of Thanksgiving has come full circle, and it&rsquo;s primarily seen as a time to gather the family, mark the start of autumn, and ... </p>        <p><em>Happy thanksgiving to family pictures</em>. <a href="./480.html">Thanksgivings for community</a>.
