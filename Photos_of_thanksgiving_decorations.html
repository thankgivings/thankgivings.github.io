        <h2><strong>Photos of thanksgiving decorations Thanksgiving words in italian</strong></h2>
        <p>Here&#39;s what we really know about the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which took place in Plymouth in 1621 among the Pilgrims and Native Americans.  For American culture, <b>the </b>story of <b>the </b>Pilgrims, including their &ldquo;<b>first Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; feast with <b>the </b>local Native Americans, has become <b>the </b>ruling creation narrative, celebrated each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games.  Who Was at the First Thanksgiving? Guests at the feast included <b>90</b> <b>Wampanoag</b> <b>Indians</b> from a nearby village, including their leader Massasoit.

In <b>1621</b>, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people shared an autumn harvest feast that is acknowledged as one of the first Thanksgiving celebrations in the...  Popular American folklore suggests the &ldquo;first Thanksgiving&rdquo; was <b>an</b> <b>idyllic</b> <b>feast</b>. This myth, which ignores the fact that the feast was never repeated and that Thanksgiving is an invented holiday, runs contrary to many realities.  In 1620, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on the Mayflower for the &quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by the Wampanoag <b>people</b>.  The native <b>people</b> knew the land well and had fished, hunted, and harvested for thousands of generations. THE SETTLERS. The people who comprised the <b>Plymouth</b> <b>Colony</b> were a group of English... </p>        <p><a href="./303.html">History of cowboys thanksgiving day games</a>.
