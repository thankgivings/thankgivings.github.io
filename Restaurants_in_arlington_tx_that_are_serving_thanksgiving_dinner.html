        <h2><strong>Restaurants in arlington tx that are serving thanksgiving dinner Thanksgiving 2024 events las vegas</strong></h2>
        <p>In September <b>1620</b>, a small ship called the Mayflower left Plymouth, England, carrying 102 passengers&mdash;an assortment of religious separatists seeking a new home where they could freely practice...  For most people, enjoying <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, apple pie. But how did the Pilgrims really...  What Was on the <b>Menu </b>at the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Traditional <b>Thanksgiving </b>dinner includes turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes but the First <b>Thanksgiving </b>likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge...  These two sources contain all we know firsthand about the first Thanksgiving food. The rest of the <b>menu</b> we can only piece together, based upon what was available, what both groups ate in times of celebration, and what the Native Americans would have (literally) brought to the table.  Have you ever wondered what the Pilgrims ate at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the <b>menu </b>was to the traditional American <b>Thanksgiving </b>meal.  <b>In </b>addition to the venison and vegetables, they ate lobsters, fat eel pies, corn bread and &ldquo;sallet herbes&rdquo; from the wild greens. This first <b>Thanksgiving </b>was celebrated <b>in </b>October. Our November date was established by President Abraham Lincoln who made it an official holiday <b>in </b>1863.  See what was really on the <b>menu</b>! For most Americans, the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Thanksgiving <b>feast</b> <b>includes</b> turkey, cranberry sauce, sweet potato casserole, pumpkin pie, and green bean casserole. The whole meal may last an hour or two.  <b>In 1620</b>, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on the Mayflower for the &quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by the Wampanoag people.  Turkey, corn, and pumpkin pie are all <b>Thanksgiving </b>staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>?
