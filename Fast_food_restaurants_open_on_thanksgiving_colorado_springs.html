        <h2><strong>Fast food restaurants open on thanksgiving colorado springs Hotel galvez thanksgiving buddy</strong></h2>
        <p>Starchy sides are pretty much non-negotiable on the <b>Thanksgiving</b> table these days, and as it turns out, those present at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> felt the same way. Potatoes weren&#39;t available in Plymouth then, but there was samp, and it was most likely eaten at the 1621 harvest celebration.  What <b>They</b> (Likely) <b>Did</b> Have at the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Venison; Fowl (geese and duck) Corn; Nuts (walnuts, chestnuts, beechnuts) Shellfish; So venison was a major ingredient, as well as fowl, but that likely included geese and ducks. Turkeys are a possibility, but were not a common food in that time. Pilgrims grew onions and herbs.  The Brewsters <b>did</b> bring their two boys with them, Love and Wrestling, about 11 and 7 at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. <b>They</b> would have helped prepare the meal, along with little Resolved White and Margaret Winslow. Richard More, their seven-year-old servant, would have helped, too.  The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. <b>They</b> played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623.  There&rsquo;s a good chance the Pilgrims and Wampanoag <b>did</b> in fact eat turkey as part of that very <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Wild turkey was a common food source for people who settled Plymouth. In the days prior to the celebration, the colony&rsquo;s governor sent four men to go &ldquo;fowling&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to hunt for birds. <b>Did</b> <b>they</b> come back with any turkey?  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was celebrated by the English Pilgrims and the Wampanoag tribe sometime between late September and early November 1621. A letter written by Pilgrim Edward Winslow provides ...  Some special and brave warriors were awarded a prized eagle feather, which <b>they</b> <b>wore</b> proudly in their headdresses. However, the giant plumage of feathered headdresses often seen in artistic depictions of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was probably embellished by the artist. Wools and Linens. The Pilgrims dressed rather similarly to the depictions we ...  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written. The <b>first</b> account is William Bradford&#39;s journal&hellip;  Today, the traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner includes any number of dishes: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, candied yams, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie. </p>        <p>Roys hawaii thanksgiving menu.
