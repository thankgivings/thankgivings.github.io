        <p>Colonists in New England and Canada regularly observed &ldquo;thanksgivings,&rdquo; days of prayer for such blessings as safe journeys, military victories, or abundant harvests. Americans model their holiday on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared between the Wampanoag people and the English colonists known as Pilgrims.  From the earliest fall feasts to the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> football game to the Macy&#39;s Day parade, here&#39;s the full background on how the U.S. holiday evolved to the tradition it is today.  President James Madison proclaimed a day of Thanksgiving to be held on <b>April</b> <b>13</b>, <b>1815</b>, the last such proclamation issued by a President until Abraham Lincoln did so in 1862. Most of the credit for the establishment of an annual Thanksgiving holiday may be given to Sarah Josepha Hale.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written. The first account is William Bradford&#39;s journal&hellip;  The First Thanksgiving is dated to <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday? Thanksgiving became an American holiday in 1863 but was not observed in every state until after 1963. Why do Native Americans object to Thanksgiving?  The legend of the American Thanksgiving holiday is said to have been based on a feast of thanksgiving in the early days of the American colonies almost <b>400</b> <b>years</b> ago. The tale as it is told in grade schools is a legend, a mythologized version that downplays some of the bleaker history of how Thanksgiving became an American national holiday.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  <b>How did</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>start</b>? Colonists in New England and Canada regularly observed &ldquo;thanksgivings,&rdquo; days of prayer for such blessings as safe journeys, military victories, or abundant harvests.
