        <p>However, the dates and even the month of &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b> Day&rdquo; varied from one presidential administration to another in the decades to come. It was not until 1939 when another Freemason, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, issued a proclamation calling for the &ldquo;second to last Thursday in November&rdquo; to be recognized as an official national ...  We all know the story of the &quot;Pilgrims and Indians&quot; celebrating the &quot;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&quot; First in the&quot;New World&quot; it may have been, but it was not the first United States Thanksgiving.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> time is here once more, Did you sit right down and tally the score? If you did, like goal Masons you&rsquo;ll start from here And practice your teachings without let or fear, The distinguishing marks of a Mason, you know, Is to give of his best in a charitable flow; For God in all His benignity Has given so much to you and to me,  The <b>Masonic</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Prayer</b> is a beautiful tradition within Freemasonry that reflects gratitude and humility. Rooted in Masonic rituals, this prayer serves as a reminder of the importance of giving thanks and seeking guidance from a higher power.  Did you know that the American version of <b>Thanksgiving</b> has a direct connection to <b>Freemasonry</b>? What is the connection and how did it involve George Washington? Find out here!  Two <b>Freemasons</b> heavily shaped the celebration that we know today. Bro. Elias Boudinot and former President and <b>Freemason</b> George Washington rallied together to create this holiday as a way to give thanks and prayer to our communities, families, and friends.  <b>Freemasonry</b> played a significant role in the development and evolution of the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday in several ways. First and foremost, many of the early leaders and founders of the colonies in North America were members of the Masonic fraternity.  Let us celebrate a lifetime of <b>thanks</b>, cherishing both the joys and the lessons of our journey. Happy Thanksgiving! Here is one of my favorite Thanksgiving Blessings from Arthur R. Herrmann at the Masonic Poets Society. A Thanksgiving Prayer. Oh, Lord, now this we&rsquo;re thankful for: The good things life has held in store;  Our brethren, our <b>Masonic</b> Family, and our fellow citizens are all suffering from the effects of sustained confinement, economic hardship, and the loss of loved ones. And yet I feel more thankful this year than ever before. </p>        <p><a href="./771.html">Macys thanksgiving day parade 2024.com</a>. <a href="./522.html">Thanksgiving ornaments amazon</a>.
