        <h2><strong>Shopping after thanksgiving Thanksgiving in the north carolina mountains</strong></h2>
        <p>Here is how Canada celebrates their big holiday as well as four ways that the Canadian and U.S. Thanksgivings differ. 1. Canadian Thanksgiving <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>October</b>&mdash;<b>and</b> on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian Thanksgiving happens a full month and a half before American Thanksgiving, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  In Canada, starting in 1921, Thanksgiving <b>and</b> <b>Armistice</b> Day were observed on the same day in November. To better honor veterans, Armistice Day was renamed Remembrance Day in 1931 and set as November 11 each year. Thanksgiving, meanwhile, did not become an official holiday in Canada until 1957.  <b>Canada</b> celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> decades before the Pilgrims, but the holiday in the U.S. and its northern neighbor have much in common.  What&#39;s the difference between <b>Thanksgiving</b> in America and <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in Canada</b>? In the United States, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November but <b>in Canada</b>, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.).  The first official, annual <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in Canada</b> was celebrated on 6 November 1879, though Indigenous peoples <b>in Canada</b> have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  What Does <b>Thanksgiving</b> Mean Today? While it originally celebrated harvests, today it&rsquo;s about giving thanks for all the good in our lives. It&rsquo;s a non-religious holiday that fosters inclusivity across cultures and beliefs. <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in Canada</b> embodies a spirit of unity and gratitude.  Unlike Americans, whose holiday recalls the Pilgrims landing in America, Canadians spend their Thanksgiving giving thanks for a successful harvest, which typically culminates by early <b>October</b> in the northern country of Canada.  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its celebration here <b>in Canada</b>, given that we will all be celebrating on October 14 th. We all learned as children about the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> myth of the first US <b>Thanksgiving</b> but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions . </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/36.html">Thanksgiving day race nyc</a>.
