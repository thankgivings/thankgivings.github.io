        <h2><strong>Vegetarian alternatives to thanksgiving turkey How to prepare a butterball turkey for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>A <b>Proclamation</b>. It has pleased Almighty God to prolong our national life another year, defending us with His guardian care against unfriendly designs from abroad and vouchsafing to us in His mercy many and signal victories over the enemy, who is of our own household.  Lincoln first proclaimed <b>Thanksgiving </b>a national holiday in October 1863. One of the most famous US leaders, President Abraham Lincoln, gave many speeches that have gone down in history. From the Gettysburg Address to his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln had a way with words.  The <b>proclamation</b> was also printed as a broadside. Copies of the broadside are at Harvard University, Yale University, and the Pierpont Morgan Library. Other copies are owned (1992) by Marshall B. Coyne, Washington, D.C., and Ralph Geoffrey Newman, Inc., Chicago.  By the President of the United States of America. A <b>Proclamation</b>. It has pleased Almighty God to vouchsafe signal victories to the land and naval forces engaged in suppressing an internal rebellion, and at the same time to avert from our country the dangers of foreign intervention and invasion.  While Seward&rsquo;s hand maneuvered the written text of the <b>decree</b>, Lincoln&rsquo;s verbal delivery was equally vital to the overall success of the effort. In delivering the Thanksgiving Proclamation, and all of his speeches, Lincoln revolutionized the communication between the President and citizens.  George Washington was the first president to proclaim a day of <b>thanksgiving</b>, issuing his request on October 3, 1789, exactly 74 years before Lincoln&#39;s. The document below sets apart the last Thursday of November &quot;as a day of <b>Thanksgiving </b>and Praise.&quot;  Amidst a raging Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln issued a &ldquo;<b>Proclamation</b> of Thanksgiving&rdquo; on October 3, 1863, 74 years to the day after President George Washington issued his first ...  Done at the city of Washington, this 15th day of July, A. D. 1863, and of the Independence of the United States of America the eighty-eighth. ABRAHAM LINCOLN. By the President: WILLIAM H. <b>SEWARD</b>, Secretary of State .  On October 3, 1863, President Lincoln issued a <b>proclamation</b> designating &ldquo;the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving.&rdquo; Lincoln&rsquo;s announcement marked the culmination of a multi-decade campaign by Sarah Josepha Hale to make Thanksgiving into a national holiday. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving vocabulary game.
