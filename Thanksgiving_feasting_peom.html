        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving feasting peom Thanksgiving loaf recipe</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and <b>November</b> in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  Thanksgiving Day in the United States is a holiday on the <b>fourth</b> Thursday of <b>November</b>. The day after is also known as Black Friday. Is Thanksgiving Day a Public Holiday? This is a state public holiday. State government offices are closed. Some schools and businesses may also be closed on this day.  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving </b>is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  In 2024, Thanksgiving will be observed on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>28</b>. Thanksgiving has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year. The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is November 22; the latest is November 28.  <b>Roosevelt</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> first Thanksgiving in office fell on November 30 because November had five Thursdays that year. Being that the holiday fell on the last day of the month meant that there were about 20 shopping days left before Christmas.  Celebrated on the Fourth Thursday of <b>November</b> every year in the United States of America, Thanksgiving Day is a federal holiday and considered a very special day when a Thanksgiving turkey is placed inside the oven in most homes in expectation of the very much looked forward to Thanksgiving Dinner which would bring many relatives, close friends ...  In 1939, Thanksgiving was set to fall on <b>November</b> <b>30</b>, leaving only 24 shopping days until Christmas.  Thanksgiving <b>2024</b> (<b>also</b> known as Thanksgiving Day) is an important federal holiday, celebrated annually on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. Thanksgiving 2024 precedes &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; and is traditionally a holiday to give thanks for the food collected at the end of the harvest season.  In the United States, Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> in <b>November</b>, as specified in a joint resolution passed by Congress in 1941 and a proclamation issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942. </p>        <p>Meijer thanksgiving hours. Tyler perry madea happy thanksgiving. Why does the internet slow down during thanksgiving.
