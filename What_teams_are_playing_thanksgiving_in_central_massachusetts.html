        <p><b>Broccoli</b> <b>Salad</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>salad</b> full of fresh crisp broccoli, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, and bacon bits. It&rsquo;s all tossed in a really easy creamy homemade dressing. Since it&rsquo;s best made ahead of time (and everyone raves about this recipe), it&rsquo;s a great potluck dish and a favorite addition to a holiday table. Simple. Delicious. Easy.  Thanksgiving <b>salads</b>, though often underappreciated, provide a fresh counterpoint to a celebration characterized by carb-heavy dishes. We rounded up Thanksgiving <b>salad</b> recipes <b>you</b> can make ahead, all of which elevate a sometimes boring requisite into an A-list star.  A <b>Broccoli</b> <b>Salad</b> Recipe That&rsquo;s Good for You. <b>Broccoli</b> <b>salad</b> is a standard cookout side dish, but the typical classic <b>broccoli</b> <b>salad</b> recipe is loaded up with sugar, ample mayo, bacon, and sharp cheddar cheese. My version is a fresher, healthier twist&mdash;I nix the sugar, meat, and cheese altogether.  Toss <b>broccoli</b>, grapes, walnuts, red onion, sunflower seeds, cranberries, and bacon bits together in a large bowl. Drizzle dressing over the salad and gently fold so ingredients are evenly coated.  Our <b>broccoli</b> <b>salad</b> recipe consists of broccoli, bacon, raisins, red onion, and a creamy, sweet dressing. Perfect for Thanksgiving dinner!  This homemade <b>broccoli</b> <b>salad</b> uses a tasty combination of fresh <b>broccoli</b>, cranberries, nuts, and bacon tossed in a tangy creamy dressing. You might want to double this recipe for a party or potluck &mdash; it goes quick!  This <b>broccoli</b> <b>salad</b> recipe is the best! It&#39;s healthy, too, thanks to the delicious honey-mustard vinaigrette (no mayo). This <b>broccoli</b> <b>salad</b> packs great for lunch and potlucks.  The vibrant colors and flavors in this crowd-pleasing roasted <b>broccoli</b> <b>salad</b> make it a must-have side dish for the holidays. For a twist, you can easily swap out the dried cranberries for raisins, chopped dried apricots or even pomegranate seeds to suit your taste or the season.  You only 15 minutes to whip up this smoky, creamy <b>broccoli</b> <b>salad</b>. The best part? It&#39;s actual best when made ahead. That&#39;ll be one less thing for you to do on Thanksgiving <b>Day</b>! Get the Broccoli <b>Salad</b> recipe. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving gorjuss. Thanksgiving for healing. Thanksgiving for 2 giada.
