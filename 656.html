        <h2><strong>Canada invented thanksgiving This is me thinking about thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>The first official, annual Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>, though Indigenous peoples in Canada have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  Some historians argue that the first Thanksgiving in North America took place in Canada in <b>1578</b>, following Martin Frobisher&rsquo;s safe arrival in Newfoundland after a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage. Even earlier, Indigenous Peoples had their own traditions for honoring the Earth&rsquo;s abundance during the fall season.  The origin of <b>Thanksgiving</b> in Canada isn&rsquo;t completely clear. Indigenous Peoples marked the fall harvest with prayer, dance and potlatch thousands of years before colonial settlers celebrated.  Canadian Thanksgiving kicked off with a feast of biscuits, salt beef, and mushy peas in <b>1578</b>. That&rsquo;s when <b>Sir</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> sailed from England in search of the Northwest Passage.  It has become common knowledge that the first Thanksgiving in North America was held by <b>Sir</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> and his crew in Nunavut in <b>1578</b>. There are those &mdash; mainly Americans upset by the thought of having their holiday co-opted &mdash; who argue that it wasn&#39;t a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Thanksgiving.  The first large, national Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated in <b>1859</b> in what was then called the province of Canada. The province of Canada was developed when Upper Canada and Lower Canada were united by Britain in 1841.  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of Thanksgiving and its celebration here in Canada, given that we will all be celebrating <b>on</b> <b>October</b> <b>14th</b>. We all learned as children about the American Thanksgiving myth of the first US Thanksgiving but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  The first Thanksgiving in Canada has been credited to <b>English</b> <b>explorer</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b>. According to historical records, he celebrated in 1578 in what we now know as Newfoundland. The first official Thanksgiving was celebrated on Nov. 6, 1879.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or Thanksgiving Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions . </p>        <p>Thanksgiving break 2024 csu.
