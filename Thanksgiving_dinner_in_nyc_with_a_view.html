        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving dinner in nyc with a view First thanksgiving federal holiday</strong></h2>
        <p>See chart of <b>how</b> much <b>turkey</b> per person so you&#39;ll know what <b>size</b> <b>turkey</b> to buy. MODERN <b>turkey</b> <b>sizing</b> list with white vs dark servings and lots more!  In order to have plenty of <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>turkey</b> for dinner, with enough for leftovers and to-go plates, remember this simple rule: one pound of <b>turkey</b> per person. You can assume about 40% to 50% of every <b>turkey</b> is bone or parts that won&#39;t be eaten.  You can use this handy chart to determine the perfect size turkey for your Thanksgiving celebration. Preparing <b>1</b>-<b>1/4</b> <b>pounds</b> of turkey per person may seem like a lot, but remember that this weight includes parts that you won&rsquo;t eat (like the bones).  Make sure you have enough <b>turkey</b> for the feast and leftovers. We took the guesswork of how much <b>turkey</b> you need per person with a handy chart.  The general rule of thumb is to plan for 1 1/4 pounds of <b>turkey</b> per guest, which takes into account the bones and other inedible parts of the turkey. That should be plenty especially with everyone&#39;s favorite Thanksgiving side dishes on the dinner table.  For smaller gatherings, Jessie recommends scaling your amount of turkey to 2 pounds per person to guarantee extra turkey for leftovers (more on that later). &ldquo;For four to six people, 11 to <b>13</b>...  A 20-pound <b>turkey</b> will feed between 12 and <b>14</b> <b>people</b>. ... Just like football coaches who are preparing for the <b>big</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, home cooks need to make a game plan for the feast.  <b>How</b> much <b>turkey</b> do you need per person? This chart will walk you through <b>how</b> much <b>turkey</b> you need for a successful <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  The rule of thumb <b>is</b> <b>1</b> <b>1/2</b> <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>turkey</b> per person with leftovers and 1 pound of turkey per person without leftovers. If your guest list includes a lot of kids, lean towards a smaller size turkey. If your guests are big eaters, lean towards a larger turkey. </p>        <p><a href="./859.html">Thanksgiving table decoir</a>. <a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/546.html">Low thanksgiving centerpieces</a>.
