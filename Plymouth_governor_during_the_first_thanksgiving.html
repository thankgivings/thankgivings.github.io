        <h2><strong>Plymouth governor during the first thanksgiving Southern menu for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>But for those of us who will be attending Thanksgiving <b>dinner</b> as a <b>guest</b>, there&rsquo;s still some preparation to be done; it&rsquo;s not as simple as just showing up in your favorite <b>elastic</b>-<b>waist</b>...  Before you head out to Thanksgiving <b>dinner</b>, Food Network will help you make sure your etiquette <b>is</b> up to snuff so that you get invited back next year.  Thanksgiving tips often focus on the host of the meal and their concerns &mdash; the scheduling, the cooking, the attention to details. But a lot of us won&rsquo;t be doing the heavy lifting this year; we&rsquo;ll simply be <b>guests</b> on The Big Day.  Here&rsquo;s some Thanksgiving advice from <b>etiquette</b> pros, including The Emily Post Institute, social strategist Deborah Ritch, president and founder of RitchImage, and the U.S. State Department. 1....  Thanksgiving <b>Etiquette</b> Q&amp;A Question: As the host, when the invitation for Thanksgiving <b>dinner</b> says 6:00, what time should I have everything on the table, ready to eat? Answer: Offer cocktails and appetizers when <b>guests</b> arrive, and serve <b>dinner</b> approximately an hour later.  For the most part, it&rsquo;s a matter of common sense and basic <b>etiquette</b> (offer to help, show up on time, be thankful); to take things to the next level, keep these dos and don&rsquo;ts in mind. Do let your host know ahead of time (and no, the day before doesn&rsquo;t count) if you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions.  On <b>Thanksgiving</b>, your sartorial efforts should match the exertions of the cook. Make the dress code smart and let guests interpret that as they see fit. Guests should be prompt but never early....  There&rsquo;s no need to follow <b>formal</b> <b>dinner</b> party <b>etiquette</b> in seating your guests at Thanksgiving. Simply place people next to others they will enjoy talking to the most. Also seat talkative people next to those who are less talkative, and vice-versa.  <b>Guest</b> <b>Dilemmas</b>. Q. Do I need to bring something to my friend&rsquo;s Thanksgiving dinner? A. If you were asked to bring a dish to share with the other guests that&rsquo;s all you need to bring. However, if the host didn&rsquo;t specify to bring anything do bring a hostess gift &ndash; a bottle of wine, gourmet chocolates, some nice jam or spread, etc. Q. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving meat pie. <b>Plymouth governor during the first thanksgiving</b>.
