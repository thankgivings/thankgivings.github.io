        <h2><strong>Restaurants open for thanksgiving in mckinney tx Thanksgiving nfl spread picks</strong></h2>
        <p>This was just the third federal <b>holiday</b> to be <b>declared</b>. Only Independence Day and Washington&rsquo;s birthday are older. <b>Thanksgiving</b> didn&rsquo;t become a national <b>holiday</b> until the height of the Civil War in 1863, when President Lincoln issued a proclamation urging Americans to ask God to &ldquo;heal the wounds of the nation.&rdquo;  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1941</b>, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day. The Senate amended the resolution establishing the holiday as the fourth Thursday, which would take into account those years when November has five Thursdays.  On October 3, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln <b>declared</b> that the last Thursday in November was to be recognized as a Day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> (Obama White House). In 1870, Congress passed legislation making <b>Thanksgiving</b> a <b>holiday</b>, but gave the president discretion to declare the date that the <b>holiday</b> would be celebrated.  President Zachary Taylor said <b>around</b> <b>1849</b> that it was up to the states to decide when and whether to declare a Thanksgiving holiday; in that period, such a holiday was often celebrated anywhere...  The colonists of <b>the</b> Massachusetts Bay Company, not the Plymouth Colony, decreed a day of thanksgiving for their victory which is often interpreted by modern-day Native Americans as the basis for the Thanksgiving holiday which many observe as a Day of Mourning and reflection.  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1941</b>, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day. The Senate, however, amended the resolution establishing the holiday as the fourth Thursday, which would take into account those years when November has five Thursdays.  Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, <b>November</b> <b>28</b>. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people...  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1863</b>, during the Civil War, Lincoln proclaimed a national day of thanksgiving to be celebrated on Thursday, November 26. The holiday was annually proclaimed by every president thereafter, and the date chosen, with few exceptions, was the last Thursday in November.  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> of <b>November</b>. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving owl pics. <a href="./56.html">Thanksgiving ecards dayspring</a>.
