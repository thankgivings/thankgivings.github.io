        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving reef for school Thanksgiving greeting free card</strong></h2>
        <p>People travel back to their ancestral homes and pay tribute to their ancestors for a good harvest. On this <b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> or <b>Korean</b> mid-autumn festival, rituals and rites are performed to pay respect to their ancestors and hope that their spirits will look after the coming generations.  Farmers reap the rewards of their labors, while family members gather to celebrate and show gratitude to their <b>ancestors</b> for the fruitful harvest. 차례, also known as Jesa (제사), is the ancestral memorial service at home.  Celebrated annually, over a course of three days, Chuseok is the Korea&#39;s equivalent of <b>Thanksgiving </b>here in the States. It&#39;s a national holiday, full of giving, sharing and gathering, to celebrate the coming of autumn and to pay respect to familial <b>ancestors</b>.  On the <b>day</b> of Chuseok, families will go again to bow to their <b>ancestors</b> and symbolically lay out a table of food and drinks, otherwise known as seongmyo. Alternatively, families may choose to conduct an ancestral ritual at home, also known as charye (차례).  Often referred to as &ldquo;<b>korean Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo;, Chuseok holds a special place in the hearts of Koreans as it represents a time <b>for </b>gratitude, family reunions, and honoring <b>ancestors</b>. In this blog post, we will explore the meaning, history, and customs associated with this cherished holiday.  Chuseok occurs on the 15th <b>day </b>of the 8th Lunar month during autumn. Chuseok offers an opportunity to express thanks and reflect on past experiences. The <b>Korean </b>people express their gratitude to their <b>ancestors for </b>the bountiful harvest they have received and pay their respects to the deceased.  Falling on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar <b>calendar</b>, Chuseok is often referred to as the Korean Thanksgiving Day. Chuseok is a time to give thanks for the bountiful harvest and pay respects to their ancestors.  The Korean Harvest Moon Festival called &ldquo;Chusok&rdquo; is over 2,000 years old, but it is now also sometimes referred to as &ldquo;<b>Korean</b> Thanksgiving&rdquo; because it is the traditional time for Koreans to thank their ancestors for the year&#39;s harvest.  One of the most important traditions of Chuseok is 차례 [cha-lyae], the ancestral memorial service. On the morning of Chuseok, <b>family</b> members gather to honor the spirits of their <b>ancestors</b> by offering food and drinks. Through this ritual, families pay respects to their <b>ancestors</b> and strengthen their familial bonds. </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/74.html">Responsorial psalm for thanksgiving mass</a>. <a href="./418.html">Vintage grocers thanksgiving</a>.
