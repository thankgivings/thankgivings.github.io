        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving sermon by adrian rogers Short thanksgiving quotes sayings</strong></h2>
        <p>Engaging in shared moments of thankfulness with family and friends creates a supportive environment that promotes emotional resilience and positivity. The traditions and rituals associated with Thanksgiving also play a significant role in promoting <b>mental</b> wellness.  During the Thanksgiving holiday many people become overwhelmed with feelings of hopelessness, despair, ruminating thoughts, and loneliness. Collaboratively these feelings during the holidays often contribute to increased reports of depression, anxiety, and other <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> disorders.  Here are a few steps you can take to prioritize your mental health during this hectic season: 1. Accept Your <b>Feelings</b>. The holidays can bring up a range of emotions for people. Sometimes you can even experience seemingly contradictory emotions all at once. Try your best to acknowledge and accept your emotions rather than place judgment on them.  <b>Gratitude</b> helps people refocus on what they have instead of what they lack. And, although it may feel contrived at first, this mental state grows stronger with use and practice. Here are some ways to cultivate gratitude on a regular basis. Write a <b>thank</b>-<b>you</b> note.  Thanksgiving is the perfect time to deepen <b>our</b> <b>gratitude</b> practice. While many of us take a moment to say what we&rsquo;re thankful for before a meal, we can expand that practice in meaningful ways. For example, keeping a gratitude journal during the month of November can help solidify this mindset.  3. Protect Your Energy with Self-Care . It&rsquo;s easy to lose yourself in the holiday rush, but taking time for self-care can be grounding. Whether it&rsquo;s a 10-minute walk in the crisp autumn air, a calming cup of tea, or a few minutes of deep breathing, these small moments can help you reset and recharge.  Research shows that expressing gratitude is good for your <b>mental</b> <b>health</b>. It increases happiness and decreases depression. It also enhances empathy and reduces aggression. It promotes social...  We know, Thanksgiving is all about indulgence&mdash;but don&rsquo;t forget to nourish your body in the lead-up to the feast. A sugar crash or hanger moment won&rsquo;t do your <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> any favors. <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> Tip: Start your day with a balanced breakfast (think protein + healthy fats), and snack on something light before the big meal to avoid ...  Thanksgiving does remind us to appreciate what one has, practice gratitude, and focus on <b>mental</b> <b>health</b>. It is more than just the turkey on the table but also about the nurturing of love and relationships. So, as Thanksgiving approaches, take a moment to reflect on your journey and the small joys that bring you happiness. </p>        <p>Why do other countries celebrate thanksgiving.
