        <h2><strong>History you are the historian thanksgiving Thanksgiving meal traditions</strong></h2>
        <p>learn about the facts and myths that surround the &quot;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; (the harvest celebration of 1621) at Plimoth Colony. learn about the role that historians play in the collection and dissemination of history.  The Plimoth Plantation has designed a comprehensive online site that builds students&rsquo; understanding about the harvest celebration of 1621, which is often erroneously referred to as &ldquo;The First <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo;  This interactive Web site from Plimoth Plantation, a Smithsonian Affiliate, focuses on clarifying fact and fiction surrounding the &ldquo;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; Students use audio from Plimoth Plantation historians, images of artifacts, and a glossary to answer questions and explore the lives of the Wamapan&hellip;  Study with Quizlet and memorize flashcards containing terms like In what month did <b>the </b>real harvest celebration likely take place?, True or false: <b>The </b>English colonists and Wampanoag people were best friends., Who was <b>the </b>leader of <b>the </b>Wampanoag people? and more.  This Teacher Toolkit includes five primary source units that correspond to an interactive module in <b>You</b> Are The <b>Historian</b>: Investigating the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. While these five units are designed to enhance the digital experience for students, <b>you</b> can also use them to supplement stand-alone in-class lessons or units of study.  &ldquo;You are the <b>Historian</b>&rdquo; Interactive Game. Get transported to Patuxet, the pre-European homeland of the Wampanoag, and be immersed in a story of cultural change and persistence that spans <b>12,000</b> <b>years</b>.  <b>You</b> Are The <b>Historian</b>: Investigating the First <b>Thanksgiving</b> focuses primarily on events leading up to the 1621 harvest feast &ndash; known today as &ldquo;the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; &ndash; while also putting the events in a broader historical context to explore how historians&rsquo; interpretation of the early years of Patuxet and Plymouth Colony has changed ...  To help students investigate what the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal really looked like, Plimoth Patuxet collaborated with FableVision to update their highly popular <b>You</b> Are The <b>Historian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> interactive in time for the <b>Thanksgiving</b> season 2020 and the 400th commemoration of the Pilgrims&rsquo; arrival on the shores of Patuxet in 1620.  Americans have long thought the history of the American holiday Thanksgiving to be relatively simple. The actual story of how the story of &ldquo;the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; was written and retold and how the holiday was developed and embraced by a nation is surprisingly complex. </p>        <p>Trumvyll ct homedepot thanksgiving.
