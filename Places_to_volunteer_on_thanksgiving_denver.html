        <p>Traditional <b>foods</b> have evolved since those early days, but plenty of indigenous crops will grace our <b>Thanksgiving</b> tables this year. If corn chips with salsa are out before dinner, the peppers and tomatoes in the salsa are Native American <b>foods</b>. For those who like guacamole dip, avocados are another native <b>food</b>.  So which foods were actually eaten during the first Thanksgiving? According to Smithsonian Magazine, there are two surviving documents which state that <b>deer</b>, <b>wildfowl</b>, <b>and</b> <b>corn</b> (in the form of <b>cornbread</b> and porridge) were eaten. Read on for more fun facts about the history of Thanksgiving food.  These two sources contain all we know firsthand about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>food</b>. The rest of the menu we can only piece together, based upon what was available, what both groups ate in times of celebration, and what the Native Americans would have (literally) brought to the table.  When you picture the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, you probably imagine a table piled high with turkey, stuffing, and pie. But what if I told you the real meal back in 1621 was way different? It shouldn&rsquo;t ...  From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  Based on the few historical documents available, including a letter sent home by a colonist, the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> included deer (venison), wildfowl, cod, bass, and a type of multi-colored corn called flint.  So what <b>foods</b> were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  The geographical landscape of Plymouth (or Plimoth Plantation as the settlers called it in 1621), was a direct link to the <b>foods</b> that were eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Plymouth&#39;s coastal location overlooking Cape Cod Bay offered a multitude of shellfish to those who inhabited the area.  What Was on the Menu at the First Thanksgiving? Traditional Thanksgiving dinner includes <b>turkey</b>, stuffing and <b>mashed</b> potatoes but the First Thanksgiving likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge... </p>        <p><a href="./643.html">Thanksgiving reservations ihop</a>.
