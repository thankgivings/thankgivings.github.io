Well, according to Costco Customer Service, all U.S. warehouse locations are closed on Thanksgiving Day on <b>November</b> <b>28</b>, <b>2024</b>. So, unfortunately, you&#39;ll need to get your shopping done ahead of time to meet those dinner needs.  If you run out of key supplies while making <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner, you may turn to your local <b>Costco</b> for help. But will the store be <b>open</b> that day?  U.S. Costco locations will be closed on <b>November</b> <b>28</b> in observance of Thanksgiving. The warehouse chain will reopen for Black Friday on November 29.  To make the most out of your <b>Thanksgiving</b> shopping, going to <b>Costco</b> makes a lot of sense, but for last-minute necessities, is the warehouse <b>open</b> on the day? Unfortunately, <b>Costco</b> will not be <b>open</b> <b>on Thanksgiving</b>, so plan for another store for last-minute shopping needs.  If your usual go-to for shopping is Costco, then here&#39;s some bad news for you: Costco <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>open</b> <b>warehouses</b> <b>this</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.
