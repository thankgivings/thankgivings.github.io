        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving school papers Thanksgiving turkey breast slow cooker recipes</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving is a celebration observed on the <b>fourth</b> Thursday <b>of</b> <b>November</b> in the United States and the second Monday of October in Canada. The celebration is about giving thanks for the blessing of the harvest and of the preceding year.  <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>religious</b> <b>problem</b> with a Muslim participating in Thanksgiving festivities in order to express thankfulness to Allah for their blessings. However, if the intention is to celebrate it as a religious holiday or to engage in actions that go against Islamic beliefs, it may become problematic.  In <b>Islam</b>, <b>thanksgiving</b> is not only a particular religious act or service; it is the whole life. The whole life should be lived in obedience to our Ultimate Benefactor, Allah. He has been good to us and so in our thankfulness we should worship Him, obey His commands and orders.  It is said that Thanksgiving had roots in religious and cultural tradition but today Thanksgiving is primarily celebrated as a secular <b>holiday</b>. [1] In principle, imitating the disbelievers in any of their religious festivals (holidays) is totally impermissible and intolerable.  1-A <b>Muslim</b> is allowed to <b>celebrate</b> any national occasion as long as it does not include any rituals that violate Shariah rulings. 2- So, a Muslim in America can share his family members celebrating Thanksgiving providing that he does not participate in any non-Islamic rituals or have any prohibited ( haram ) foods or drinks.  Our daily prayers, our fasting during Ramadan, our Zakat and Hajj are all our acts of <b>thanksgiving</b>.  Although <b>Thanksgiving</b> is not a religious holiday or observance and is not commemorated as such, Muslims in America are naturally drawn to this holiday because of the spirit of gratitude and service that it embodies.  The simple answer: Islam <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, but Muslims might. Ibn&rsquo; Umar (RAA) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: &ldquo;He who imitates any people (in their actions) is considered to be one of them.&rdquo;  In <b>Islam</b> we have two forms of <b>thanksgiving</b>. The first is called hamd and the second is termed shukr. Hamd is to thank someone for something because they gave you something out of their generosity. When someone demonstrates kindness to you and doesn&rsquo;t expect anything in return from you, your thanking them is called hamd. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving dinner harlem. <b>Thanksgiving school papers</b>.
