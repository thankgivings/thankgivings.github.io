        <h2><strong>What restaurants are open on thanksgiving day in marlborough ma Felix the cat thanksgiving parade 1926</strong></h2>
        <p>In the afternoon of <b>Sunday</b>, <b>Oct</b>. 3, 2021, the chapel of St. Joseph Monastery in Whitesville, home to a community of cloistered Passionist nuns, held a celebration in thanksgiving for 75 years in the Diocese of Owensboro.  As contemplative <b>nuns</b>, our primary duty for the Church is prayer. If you have a prayer request, simply enter it in the form below. Upon receiving it, we will post it on our prayer board outside of our Choir for all the <b>nuns</b> to see.  Amid the festivities and food of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, I try to do some spiritual thanksgiving <b>through</b> attending mass and personal reflection. During mass, when we celebrate the Eucharist, we are offering our thanks to God for the gift of Jesus&rsquo; life, death, and resurrection.  It became known as the <b>Nun</b> Study. Some 700 American nuns, all members of the School Sisters of Notre Dame in the United States, agreed to allow their records to be accessed by a research team investigating the process of ageing and Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease.  It&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> this week in the U.S. The holiday brings to mind a conference I attended recently, where people talked a lot about the connection between &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; and &ldquo;giving.&rdquo; The conference was held by Catholic Volunteer Network (CVN) earlier this month in Cleveland, Ohio.  &ldquo;Have a nice day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thanks, you too.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a polite gesture which actually has some very profound meaning behind it. The word gratitude speaks to that deeper dimension. The word gratitude comes from the medieval Latin words gratitudo and gratus which mean &ldquo;thankful.&rdquo;  The <b>contemplative</b> <b>nun</b> seeks to fulfill to the highest degree the command to love the Lord with all one&rsquo;s heart, soul, mind and strength (Lk 10:27), to seek him as the &ldquo;one thing necessary&rdquo; (Lk 10:42), to choose him as the &ldquo;pearl of great price&rdquo; (Mt 13:45-46) and to envelope herself within the mystery of a total and exclusive love.  As contemplative nuns, our primary duty for the Church <b>is</b> <b>prayer</b>. If you have a prayer request, simply enter it in the form below. Upon receiving it, we will post it on our prayer board outside of our Choir for all the nuns to see.  Here are some prayers and resources for <b>Thanksgiving</b> worship. for Your acts of love and faithfulness toward us! You provide for our needs. You inspire worship and praise! Even nature celebrates Your goodness. for Your mercy and Your faithful love toward us. our <b>thanksgiving</b>. that we may hear Your Word and know Your will. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving buffet myrtle beach.
