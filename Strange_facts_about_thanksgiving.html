        <h2><strong>Strange facts about thanksgiving Mashed sweet potato recipes for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p><b>At</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> did the Pilgrims/Native Americans eat roasted kernels of corn or popped corn, or was there no corn <b>served</b> in that matter at all? Only two sources contain eyewitness accounts of what has become known as the &quot;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&quot; Neither account mentions whether corn was roasted, popped, or <b>served</b> at all.  Most historians agree that corn was on the menu <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. (Credit: Wikipedia) Held in 1621 after the completion of the fall harvest, the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> lasted for three days. Unfortunately, there is very little documentation of what was <b>served</b> at the celebration.  <b>Was Popcorn</b> Really Eaten <b>at</b> the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? While there are myths about <b>popcorn</b> being <b>served</b> <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, historical records do not support this claim. The Pilgrims and Native Americans likely enjoyed other forms of corn, such as boiled or ground cornmeal dishes, rather than popped corn.  <b>Flint</b> <b>corn</b> is most similar to the modern popcorn: an exceedingly hard, minimally starchy variety. Common preparations at the time, as attested to by Bradford, was typically hand-ground and then stewed to make a porridge.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was celebrated by the English Pilgrims and the Wampanoag tribe sometime between late September and early November 1621. A letter written by Pilgrim Edward Winslow...  It&rsquo;s been said that <b>popcorn</b> was part of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast, in Plymouth Colony in 1621. According to myth, Squanto himself taught the Pilgrims to raise and harvest corn, and pop the kernels for a delicious snack.  Two primary sources&mdash;<b>the </b>only surviving documents that reference <b>the </b>meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of <b>the </b>harvest celebration shared by <b>the </b>Pilgrims and Wampanoag <b>at </b>Plymouth Colony in...  Like many of the foods eaten <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, American chestnuts were probably prepared multiple ways for the occasion. Ground chestnuts, along with walnuts, beechnuts, and acorns commonly <b>served</b> as thickeners in stew, or sobaheg, in the Wampanoag language. Another possibility is that chestnuts were used for stuffing inside roasted birds.  Was Popcorn Served at the &#39;First Thanksgiving&#39;? <b>In</b> <b>1621</b>, two groups from different cultures (the Pilgrim settlers and the local Wampanoag tribe) -- who both already had traditions of an autumn feast of thanksgiving -- chose to share a meal and celebrate together. </p>        <p>Strange facts about thanksgiving.
