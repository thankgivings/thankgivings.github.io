        <h2><strong>What is a vegand thanksgiving Grocery stores open on thanksgiving in vacaville</strong></h2>
        <p>Few will remember it in today&rsquo;s secularized <b>Europe</b>, but the feast of St. Martin of Tours, celebrated on Nov. 11 each year, has for centuries held a similar significance to <b>Thanksgiving</b> in the U.S.  Today, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is celebrated in many parts of Germany, with customs and <b>traditions</b> that are unique to each region. From parades and feasts to gift-giving and charity events, <b>Thanksgiving</b> has become a beloved holiday in Germany that brings people together to give thanks and celebrate the harvest season.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> in German <b>Europe</b> has a long <b>tradition</b>, but one that is different in many ways from that in North America. First of all, the Germanic Erntedankfest (&quot;harvest festival of thanks&quot;) is primarily a rural and a religious celebration.  In Germany, <b>Thanksgiving</b>&mdash; (&ldquo;das Erntedankfest,&rdquo; i.e.,<b>Thanksgiving</b> Harvest Festival)&mdash;is strongly entrenched in German culture. Erntedankfest is usually observed on the first Sunday of October (04 October 2015 this year), although the timing is not hard and fast nationwide.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> in America may be a <b>tradition</b> dating back to the 17th century, but in Germany and the rest of <b>Europe</b>, harvest celebrations have been a fixture since pagan times. We take a look at the Erntedank harvest festival and explain why it&rsquo;s sometimes considered the &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b> of Germany&rdquo;.  From the earliest fall feasts to the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> football game to the Macy&#39;s Day parade, here&#39;s the full background on how the U.S. holiday evolved to the <b>tradition</b> it is today.  German <b>Thanksgiving</b>, otherwise known as &lsquo;Erntedank,&rsquo; has certain traditions in common with American Thanksgiving. But it is clearly its own holiday.  A description of the <b>traditions</b> for German <b>Thanksgiving</b> (Erntedank), as well as a history of <b>Thanksgiving</b> in North America and the ways it is celebrated.  The meaning of the German <b>Thanksgiving</b> (Erntedank), how it differs from <b>Thanksgiving</b> in North America and why it is still very important for us today! </p>        <p>Thanksgiving wallpaper aesthetic. <a href="./564.html">Best restaurant for thanksgiving dinner in iowa</a>.
