        <h2><strong>Thank you prayer to god on my birthday Is mookies open on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>The Akathist of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, &#39;Glory to God for All Things&#39;, is included in the new St Tikhon&#39;s Orthodox <b>Christian</b> <b>Prayers</b>, which has a number of special services and prayers in addition to Morning and Evening Prayers, and Prayers in Preparation for Holy Communion.  We are found in the season of <b>Thanksgiving</b> when we offer gratitude to God as a nation and as individuals for His blessing and love for us. Today, November 21st our Church celebrates a unique feast of gratitude, the Entry of the Theotokos to the Temple.  Keep us in Thy holiness, that all the day we may meditate upon Thy righteousness. Alleluia! A litany of <b>thanksgiving</b> is then sung to the Lord with prayers of gratitude that he has blessed his people with participation in the &ldquo;heavenly and immortal mysteries.&rdquo;  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is an essential expression of our worship and prayer as Orthodox <b>Christians</b>. When we gather in our parishes and when we direct our minds and hearts toward God seeking His guidance, we offer our deepest gratitude to Him for His love and the gift of salvation.  <b>Orthodox</b> Eucharistic <b>thanks-giving</b> worship to God starts at 10 a.m. at the Lewisburg Club, 131 Market St., back entrance, and will be immediately followed by an informal <b>Thanksgiving</b> smorgasbord (a feast of gratitude that will precede the start of our Nativity Fast, which we will also mark on Wed. 11/27&ndash;<b>Thanksgiving</b> Eve&ndash;with the ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> defines our Faith. As <b>Orthodox</b> Christians, we should give thanks to God every day, not just once a year. This, in effect, makes every day <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day for us. In the Vespers service, we hear in Psalm 104: &ldquo;I will sing praises to my God while I have my being&rdquo;.  In the Church, we are to give thanks not just once a year, but always, so that every day is a <b>thanksgiving</b> day. We are taught this at Vespers: &ldquo;I will sing praises to my God while I have my being!&rdquo; (from Psalm 104).  Therefore, my beloved <b>Christians</b>, on this Thanksgiving Day, let us look beyond to the truth of God&rsquo;s providential love for us, and offer Him the gratitude which can transform our world into His Kingdom. With gratitude for each and every one of you in the love of our Lord Jesus Christ, &dagger; <b>ELPIDOPHOROS</b>. Archbishop of America.  The Greek <b>Orthodox</b> Archdiocese of America, with its headquarters located in the City of New York, is an Eparchy of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, The mission of the Archdiocese is to proclaim the Gospel of Christ, to teach and spread the <b>Orthodox</b> <b>Christian</b> faith, to energize, cultivate, and guide the life of the Church in the United States of America according to the <b>Orthodox</b> ... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving dinner wet chester pa.
