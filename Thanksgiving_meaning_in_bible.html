        <p>NEW YORK CITY, N.Y. &mdash; The Macy&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Parade</b>, an iconic American tradition, made its debut on November 27, 1924.

The Macy&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving Day Parade</b> is an annual <b>parade</b> in New York City presented by the U.S.-based department store chain Macy&#39;s.The <b>Parade</b> <b>first</b> took place in 1924, [2]: 9 tying it for the second-oldest <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>parade</b> in the United States with America&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Parade</b> in Detroit (with both parades being four years younger than Philadelphia&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving Day Parade</b>).  On Nov. 27, 1924 at 9 a.m., <b>the first</b> Macy&rsquo;s <b>parade</b> started its way down a 6-mile route through the main streets of New York City. Since then, the <b>parade</b> route has been trimmed to 2.5 miles and the <b>parade</b> has grown, becoming one of the most beloved American traditions and bringing millions of people together every <b>Thanksgiving</b> morning.

In 1924, Macy&#39;s held its <b>first</b> <b>parade</b> but instead of focusing on <b>Thanksgiving</b> it was called Macy&#39;s Christmas <b>Parade</b>. The <b>parade</b> was held just by store employees and the hope was the...  <b>The first</b> <b>Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade</b>, held November 27, 1924, was called &ldquo;Macy&rsquo;s Christmas <b>Parade</b>&rdquo; and aimed at ginning up demand for Christmas shopping. Macy&rsquo;s held the <b>parade</b> to celebrate the opening of what it called the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Largest Store&rdquo;&mdash;more than 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 square meters) of retail space that ...  When was <b>the first</b> televised <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Parade</b>? In 1948, The Macy&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Parade</b> was nationally broadcasted for <b>the first</b> time on CBS. That was over 20 years after its inception, though it makes sense when you realize cable wasn&#39;t even invented until earlier that year.  After going public in 1922, <b>R</b>. <b>H</b>.
