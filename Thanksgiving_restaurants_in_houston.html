        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving restaurants in houston Boston sports club thanksgiving hours</strong></h2>
        <p>While the Pilgrims and Native Americans did break bread together, that&#39;s not the end of the story. Here&#39;s the <b>real</b> story of <b>Thanksgiving</b>&#39;<b>s</b> history.  Four hundred years later, the so-called first <b>Thanksgiving</b> is undergoing a reassessment. Museums and historic sites in Plymouth and around the country are telling a more nuanced story about the...  The colonists of the Massachusetts <b>Bay</b> Company, not the Plymouth Colony, decreed a day of thanksgiving for their victory which is often interpreted by modern-day Native Americans as the basis for the Thanksgiving holiday which many observe as a Day of Mourning and reflection.  Here&#39;s what we really know about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which took place in Plymouth in 1621 among the Pilgrims and Native Americans.  But some historians argue that Florida, not Massachusetts, may have been the <b>true</b> site of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> in North America. In 1565, nearly 60 years before Plymouth, a Spanish fleet came...  Today, as millions <b>of </b>American families gather together in celebration <b>of Thanksgiving</b>, many remain unaware <b>of the real </b>history behind <b>the </b>holiday. While in school, most children are taught that...  Every November, Americans gather around the table to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> in commemoration of the 17th-century partnership between the newly arrived English colonists and the Indigenous ...  This mythologized <b>version</b> hides the diversity of American society and our immigrant origins. It also hides much of the conflict and tragedy associated with the European settlement of the Americas. <b>Thanksgiving</b> is marked by a National Day of Mourning by Native Americans, whose populations were decimated by European contact and settler colonialism.  Editor&#39;s Note: This story first published in 2020. The traditional story <b>of Thanksgiving</b>, and by extension the Pilgrims &mdash; the one repeated in school history books and given the Peanuts treatment in &quot;A Charlie Brown <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; &mdash; doesn&rsquo;t start in 1620, with the cold and seasick Pilgrims stepping off the Mayflower onto Plymouth Rock. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving story script.
