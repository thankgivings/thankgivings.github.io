        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving prayer for healthcare workers Don quiote thanksgiving turkey order</strong></h2>
        <p>Jesus wondered where the nines attitude of gratitude was. Where is the simple &ldquo;<b>thank</b> you&rdquo; for all God has done? Alice Walker says it like this, &ldquo;&#39;Thank you&#39; is the best prayer that anyone could say. I say that one a lot. Thank you expresses extreme gratitude, humility, understanding.&rdquo;  In the gospel of Luke we read the story of the <b>10</b> <b>Lepers</b> who were healed by Jesus. One of these men returned and thanked Jesus for healing him, but the other nine forgot. We know that God is worthy of our praise now at <b>Thanksgiving</b> and all year. This <b>lesson</b> will encourage children to thank God for all that He has done for them.  This free Sunday School <b>lesson</b> is based on Luke 17:11-17, when Jesus healed <b>10</b> <b>lepers</b> but only one returned to offer him <b>thanks</b>. Download the printable version below and watch the craft example video below.  Children&rsquo;s Story idea: Discuss with the children the importance of saying <b>thank</b> you. With a helper demonstrate various ways we do that; giving pat on the back, shaking a hand, <b>giving</b> a hug, and <b>giving</b> a <b>thank</b> you card. Explain that it is important to give thanks to God.  This free Sunday School <b>lesson</b> is based on Luke 17:11-17, when Jesus healed <b>10</b> <b>lepers</b> but only one returned to offer him <b>thanks</b>. Download the printable version below and watch the craft example video below.  <b>Thankfulness</b> is an important trait to instill in children. Because Thanksgiving is coming, it&rsquo;s the perfect time to focus on having gratitude for the blessings God has given us. In this lesson, the healing the lepers receive should invoke a thankful heart from all of them, although only one returns to thank Jesus. But  A <b>10</b> <b>lepers</b> object <b>lesson</b> focuses on Jesus&#39; healing power and people&#39;s response. Use these resources to teach children about gratitude to God. After Jesus heals the <b>lepers</b>, only one returns to say thank you.  This free Sunday School <b>lesson</b> is based on Luke 17:11-17, when Jesus healed <b>10</b> <b>lepers</b> but only one returned to offer him <b>thanks</b>.
