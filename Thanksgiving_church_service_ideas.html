        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving church service ideas Channel for macys thanksgiving day parade</strong></h2>
        <p>It was President Lincoln who declared Thanksgiving a national celebration <b>in</b> <b>1863</b>. The Plymouth Pilgrims simply celebrated survival, as well as the hopes of good fortune in the years that lay ahead.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the <b>pilgrims</b> of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.

Believed to be a calm, celebratory meal, the first Thanksgiving has been revered as one of the most iconic moments in America&#39;s early history.  The <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag shared a harvest feast, but it didn&#39;t happen the way you were likely taught in school. Every November, Americans gather around the table to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> in ...  <b>Cranberries</b> were eaten by Native Americans and used as a potent red dye, but sweetened cranberry relish was almost certainly not on the first Thanksgiving table. The pilgrims had long exhausted... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving classroom activities.
