        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving horror stories Thanksgiving day high school football games in massachusetts</strong></h2>
        <p>Holidays today, tomorrow, and upcoming holidays in <b>Bulgaria</b>, including types like federal, national, statutory, and public holidays.  Despite this, however, I had a wonderful time at not one, but two fantastic <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations with my new <b>Bulgarian</b> family and friends! Though I was 6,090 miles away from those I spent my first 18 <b>Thanksgivings</b> with, the holiday was still overflowing with kindness, love, and community.  Learn more about our traditions, festivals and explore the country as a local. Here are some ideas if you want to plan this year or next one&hellip;or two&hellip; Check with us the dates for the upcoming festivals, before you start your trip. January &ndash; International festival of the Masquerade games.  We celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> in Sofia, <b>Bulgaria</b>. Some of the traditional dishes of the American holiday were not available over here, so we had to be creative ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Around the World How do other countries celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We give you four thankful festivals from Europe, Asia, and Africa.  <b>Bulgarian</b> holidays focus in large part on the country&rsquo;s long road back to being an independent state after centuries of being part of the Ottoman Empire. They also feature many holidays connected with the <b>Bulgarian</b> Orthodox Church, which helped preserve <b>Bulgarian</b> culture during that occupation.  Tradition is important and my family and I embrace our <b>Thanksgiving</b> traditions by preparing the special dishes for Thanksgiving. What traditions do you and your family hold? Happy Thanksgiving! October, November and December are my three favorite months of the year. November brings joy and celebration with Thanksgiving, an old-time tradition.  Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter (Easter Sunday and Monday) as determined for Easter celebrations in the relevant year. If any of the public holidays falls on a Saturday and/or Sunday, the first or the first two business days following that public holiday shall be non-working days.  The Easter Holy week is one of the biggest events in the <b>Bulgarian</b> religious year. The festival of Velikden, as it is known, falls in late February or early April and begins with Palm Sunday and leads up to the Great Day the following Sunday. </p>        <p>Mma thanksgiving.
