        <p>Washington issued a proclamation on October 3, 1789, designating Thursday, <b>November</b> <b>26</b> as a national day of thanks.  On October 3, 1789, George Washington issued his <b>Thanksgiving</b> proclamation, designating for &ldquo;the People of the United States a day of public <b>thanks-giving</b>&rdquo; to be held on &ldquo;Thursday the <b>26th</b> day of <b>November</b>,&rdquo; 1789, marking the first national celebration of a holiday that has become commonplace in today&rsquo;s households.  On October 3, 1789, President George Washington issued a proclamation naming Thursday, <b>November</b> <b>26</b>, 1789, as an official holiday of &quot;sincere and humble thanks.&quot; The nation then celebrated its first <b>Thanksgiving</b> under its new Constitution.  In 2024, Thanksgiving will be observed on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>28</b>. Thanksgiving has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year. The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is November 22; the latest is November 28.  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of <b>November</b>. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  A few days later, President George Washington issued a proclamation naming Thursday, <b>November</b> <b>26</b>, 1789 as a &quot;Day of Publick <b>Thanksgivin</b>&quot; - the first time Thanksgiving was celebrated under the new Constitution.  President George Washington was the first to issue a proclamation for the holiday in 1789, designating Thursday, <b>November</b> <b>26</b> &ldquo;for the People of the United States a day of public <b>thanksgiving</b>. &rdquo; This marked the first national celebration of the holiday under the new Constitution.  In 1789 Pres. George Washington decreed Thursday, <b>November</b> <b>26</b>, as a day of public <b>thanksgiving</b>, but, in the years that followed, the holiday bounced informally from month to month and date to date. The last Thursday in <b>November</b> became the norm in 1863 with a declaration by Pres. Abraham Lincoln.  In his first presidential proclamation, George Washington designated <b>November</b> <b>26</b>, 1789 as a Day of National <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The next president to issue a <b>Thanksgiving</b> Proclamation was Abraham Lincoln, who in 1863, also designated <b>November</b> <b>26</b>. </p>        <p><a href="./929.html">What are cracker barrel hours on thanksgiving</a>.
