        <h2><strong>Cute thanksgiving day jokes Ambler thanksgiving house fire</strong></h2>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>ate</b> at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  What Did the Pilgrims Eat on the First Thanksgiving? Many dishes served during modern Thanksgiving meals were not present at the first Thanksgiving. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have <b>potatoes</b>, nor did they have butter or flour necessary for making pies.  When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>did</b> <b>eat</b> turkey in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of the harvest celebration shared by the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony in...  So <b>what foods</b> were served at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  These two sources contain all we know firsthand about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>food</b>. The rest of the menu we can only piece together, based upon what was available, what both groups ate in times of celebration, and what the Native Americans would have (literally) brought to the table.  <b>Turkey</b>, <b>corn</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> are all Thanksgiving staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the first Thanksgiving? The answer might surprise you!  For most people, <b>enjoying</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, <b>well</b>, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>. But how did the Pilgrims...  What Did the Pilgrims Eat? Today, we <b>eat</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>stuffing</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>vegetables</b> as the base feast for our Thanksgivings. We also tend to have lots of pies and bread. </p>        <p><a href="./294.html">Wild rice recipes for thanksgiving</a>. What is a thanksgiving sandwich called.
