        <p>Thanksgiving parades, similar to those in the United States, are held in cities across Canada, with floats, marching bands, and performances. The largest and most famous of these parades is <b>the</b> <b>Kitchener</b>-<b>Waterloo</b> <b>Oktoberfest</b> Thanksgiving Day Parade in Ontario. Gratitude and Reflection  Canadian Thanksgiving has fewer blow-out events as its American counterpart does. American Thanksgiving is a big day for parades, particularly the Macy&rsquo;s <b>Parade</b>. While Canada does have some Thanksgiving Day parades, they&rsquo;re generally much smaller and held on a local level.  Celebrating your first <b>Thanksgiving</b> in Canada? Here&rsquo;s a quick guide to common traditions and history. From sharing a feast to great fall weekend activities, here&rsquo;s how to enjoy this cherished Canadian holiday! Why Do We Celebrate?  Here is how Canada celebrates their big holiday as well as four ways that the <b>Canadian</b> and U.S. Thanksgivings differ. 1. <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> is in October&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> happens a full month and a half before American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  Get in the holiday spirit at these five fun <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>parades</b> that are full of balloons, floats, marching bands and more. Ease into <b>Thanksgiving</b> with these helpful holiday travel tips.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or Thanksgiving Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  <b>Thanksgiving</b> was first observed as an annual event in Canada on 6 November 1879. The date for each of the following years, as well as a unifying theme for which to give thanks (usually concerning the harvest, though anniversaries related to the British monarchy were also common), was determined annually by Parliament.  We&#39;ll start with the biggie: when is <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, anyway? Unlike <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which always falls on the fourth Thursday of November no matter the date, Canada&#39;s version occurs on the second Monday in October&mdash;which is October 9 in 2023. That&#39;s about six weeks before <b>Thanksgiving</b>, although <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> coincidentally ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> in the United States is characterized by large <b>parades</b>, the Macy&#39;s Parade being most well known. Parades in Canada are smaller and at a local level. The Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest parade serves as Canada&#39;s only Thanksgiving Day parade and is broadcast nationwide. </p>        <p>Boston market thanksgiving sale.
