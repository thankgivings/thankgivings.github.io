        <h2><strong>What to get someone for thanksgiving Decorating cards for thanksgiving for kids</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving </b>is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving </b>to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Thanksgiving traditions can be traced back to <b>harvest</b> festivals, when the Pilgrims from England and the Native Americans they encountered gave thanks for a bountiful <b>harvest</b>.  A celebration of family, food and football, the tradition of a festive, <b>harvest</b>-<b>time</b> meal evolved from a letter penned by the esteemed settler about an obscure event held in the fall of 1621 at...  The first of the Thanksgiving <b>Harvest</b> Balls begins Saturday, November 23rd at 5:00 PM Pacific <b>Time</b> and lasts until 7:00 PM Pacific <b>Time</b> (8:00 to 10:00 PM Eastern). Sunday, November 24th we will have our second Thanksgiving <b>Ball</b> at 12:00 PM Pacific <b>Time</b> (3:00 PM Eastern <b>Time</b>, 8:00 PM in the UK).  They played <b>ball</b> games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 <b>harvest</b> gathering, the first recorded religious Thanksgiving Day in Plymouth happened...  Here we give you a rundown of everything you need to know about the <b>Thanksgiving </b>cornucopia (pronounced kor&middot;nuh&middot; kow &middot;pee&middot;uh), its origins, and it symbolism. Knowing a bit about the horn-shaped basket is super to take your <b>Thanksgiving </b>trivia skills next level.  The <b>Harvest</b> Thanksgiving Festival, Erntedankfest, is a popular Christian festival in some German municipalities on the first Sunday of October. The festival has a significant religious component, and many churches are decorated with autumn crops.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day, observed in 2024 on Thursday, November 28, honors a 1621 feast between Plymouth colonists and the Wampanoag people.  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving </b>is generally understood to be inspired by the <b>harvest </b>feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621. </p>        <p>Images of macys thanksgiving parade.
