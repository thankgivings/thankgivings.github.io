        <h2><strong>How busy are airports the day after thanksgiving What are some traditional thanksgiving dishes</strong></h2>
        <p>In 6-quart container or stockpot, mix water, salt and sugar; stir until sugar and salt are dissolved. Add <b>turkey</b>. Cover; refrigerate at least 12 hours but no longer than 24 hours.  This simple <b>turkey</b> <b>brine</b> works overnight to ensure your <b>turkey</b> is moist, juicy, and full of delicious flavor! Use this easy <b>brine</b> on a fresh <b>turkey</b>, not on one already injected with any other brining solution. This <b>recipe</b> makes enough <b>brine</b> for a <b>turkey</b> in the 15- to 20-pound range.  More <b>Recipes</b> to Use This <b>Brine</b>! Besides brining a whole <b>turkey</b>, you can also use this <b>recipe</b> to <b>brine</b> <b>turkey</b> <b>breasts</b>, <b>turkey</b> legs, or even whole chicken. You need need enough <b>brine</b> to cover the meat. Stick to the basic ratio of 4 quarts of water and 1 cup of kosher salt and scale it up or down as needed. And omit the salting steps in the ...  Make the <b>brine</b> by boiling the first six ingredients in a stockpot.; Let the <b>brine</b> cool slightly, then transfer it to a bucket or stockpot. Add the ice water and stir.  Combine 1/2 cup salt, the sugar and 1 quart water in a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir until the salt and sugar are fully dissolved, about 1 minute.  Add the <b>turkey</b> to the <b>brine</b>. Cover the pot. If you use a Ziploc bag, put it in another bowl in case there is some leakage. Put the pot in the fridge. Let the <b>turkey</b> sit in the <b>brine</b> for 4-24 hours. Take the <b>turkey</b> out of the <b>brine</b>. Rinse the <b>turkey</b> off and pat dry. Rub butter over the top. Season well with salt and pepper and some fresh rosemary.  Tips for Making the Best <b>Brined</b> <b>Turkey</b>. Buy the right size <b>turkey</b> <b>breast</b>. I used a whole <b>turkey</b> <b>breast</b> (two <b>breasts</b>, still joined at the <b>breast</b> bone) that weighed about 5 pounds, which is enough to feed 4 to 6 people. Plan on serving 0.5 &ndash; 1lb of <b>turkey</b> per person. Make sure the <b>turkey</b> <b>breast</b> is fully thawed before brining it.  Step 1 Combine all of the ingredients in a large pot and bring to a boil, stirring until the salt and sugar dissolve. Turn off the heat, cover, and allow the <b>brine</b> to cool completely.  <b>Brine</b> the <b>turkey</b> <b>breast</b> for 12 to 24 hours, but no longer than 24 hours or the <b>brine</b> will make the meat start to turn mushy when cooked. When ready to cook, or if the 24 hours elapses, remove the <b>turkey</b> and pat dry with paper towels or a clean dishtowel. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving keto. Thanksgiving doodle coloring pages.
