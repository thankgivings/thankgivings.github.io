        <h2><strong>What time do the viking play on thanksgiving Thanksgiving dinner order restaurant</strong></h2>
        <p>No, the <b>first Thanksgiving</b> was probably held outdoors, including the meals. The English houses were too small to get everyone inside. Did they eat turkey? We don&#39;t think so.  However, many of the <b>foods</b> we associate with a traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner actually weren&rsquo;t available for the <b>first</b> feast, which stretched for three days. So what <b>foods</b> were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes.  Metheny: The &ldquo;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; which took place in the fall of 1621 at the site of Patuxet (present-day Plymouth, Mass.), was reflective of several English traditions: a harvest festival, typically held in the autumn after the harvest was successfully brought in, as well as a religious tradition of fasting and prayer, followed by ...  So which foods were actually eaten during the first Thanksgiving? According to Smithsonian Magazine, there are two surviving documents which state that <b>deer</b>, <b>wildfowl</b>, <b>and</b> <b>corn</b> (in the form of cornbread and <b>porridge</b>) were eaten. Read on for more fun facts about the history of Thanksgiving food.  Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were <b>part</b> of the harvest celebration shared by the Pilgrims and Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony in...  From <b>seafood</b> <b>to</b> <b>carrots</b>, historians report that what was eaten at the first Thanksgiving probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  In 1620, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on <b>the </b>Mayflower for <b>the </b>&quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by <b>the </b>Wampanoag people.  There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest meal. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn bread and porridge.  When the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag shared the first Thanksgiving in <b>1621</b>, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>, and <b>turkey</b> were missing from the table. </p>        <p>What time do the viking play on thanksgiving. <a href="./432.html">Happy thanksgiving missing loved ones</a>.
