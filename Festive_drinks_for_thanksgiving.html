        <p>According to the Texas Society Daughters of the American Colonists, the very first thanksgiving was observed by Spanish explorer <b>Francisco</b> Vasquez <b>de</b> <b>Coronado</b>. Accompanied by 1,500 men in...  As President, on October 3, <b>1789</b>, George <b>Washington</b> made the following proclamation and created the first Thanksgiving Day designated by the national government of the United States of America:  In 1620, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on <b>the </b>Mayflower for <b>the </b>&quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by <b>the </b>Wampanoag people.  Some Florida historians have argued that this feast&mdash;and not the one held 56 years later by the Pilgrims and Wampanoags in <b>Plymouth</b>, <b>Massachusetts</b>&mdash;<b>was</b> actually North America&rsquo;s first...  What is the date of the First Thanksgiving? The First Thanksgiving is dated to <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday? Thanksgiving became an American holiday in 1863 but was not observed in every state until after 1963. Why do Native Americans object to Thanksgiving?  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is an annual national holiday in the United <b>States</b> and Canada that celebrates the blessings of the past year. How did <b>Thanksgiving</b> start? Colonists in New England and Canada regularly observed &ldquo;thanksgivings,&rdquo; days of prayer for such blessings as safe journeys, military victories, or abundant harvests.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> service known to be held by Europeans in North America occurred on May 27, 1578, in Newfoundland, although earlier Church-type services were probably held by Spaniards in La Florida.  The area surrounding the site of the first Thanksgiving, now known as <b>southeastern</b> <b>Massachusetts</b> <b>and</b> eastern Rhode <b>Island</b>, had been the home of the Wampanoag people for over 12,000 years,...  But some historians argue that <b>Florida</b>, not <b>Massachusetts</b>, may have been the true site of the first Thanksgiving in North America. In 1565, nearly 60 years before Plymouth, a Spanish fleet came... </p>        <p>Watsontown inn thanksgiving buffet. <a href="./132.html">Thanksgiving words that begin with x</a>.
