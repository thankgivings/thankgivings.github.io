        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the <b>history</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday&#39;s <b>history</b> in North America is rooted in English traditions dating from the Protestant Reformation. It also has aspects of a harvest festival , even though the harvest in New England occurs well before the late-November date on which the modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday is celebrated.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is the annual holiday that takes place throughout the United States on the last Thursday of November. Typically associated with family get-togethers and feasts including turkey, cranberries, and pumpkin pie, <b>Thanksgiving</b> has a long <b>history</b> that dates as far back as the early settlers in Plymouth.  The legend of the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday is said to have been based on a feast of <b>thanksgiving</b> in the early days of the American colonies almost 400 years ago. The tale as it is told in grade schools is a legend, a mythologized version that downplays some of the bleaker <b>history</b> of how <b>Thanksgiving</b> became an American national holiday.  Festivals of <b>Thanksgiving</b> were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years. They tended to be autumn harvest celebrations. But in 1789, Elias Boudinot, Massachusetts, member of the House of Representatives, moved that a day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> be held to thank God for giving the American people the opportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their hard won freedoms.  6. American <b>Thanksgiving</b> stemmed from English harvest traditions. <b>Thanksgiving</b> in North America is rooted in traditions that date to the English Reformation. Days of <b>Thanksgiving</b> had become more popular following the reign of Henry VIII, in reaction to the large number of existing Catholic religious holidays.  The king brought five deer to the three-day party, which 19th-century New Englanders would later promote as the <b>origin</b> of modern <b>Thanksgiving</b>. November 23, 1775: Boston Patriots Call for <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  Plymouth Colony &amp; First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>St boniface thanksgiving raffle 2024. <a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/838.html">Golden corral utah thanksgiving</a>.
