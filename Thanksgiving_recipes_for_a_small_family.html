        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving recipes for a small family Walmart mililani thanksgiving hours</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Drive</b> <b>Sober</b> <b>or</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Pulled</b> <b>Over</b>, which runs from August 14-September 2, aims to educate people about the dangers and consequences of driving drunk. Before drinking, plan a safe and sober ride home. Don&rsquo;t let someone get behind the wheel if they&#39;ve been drinking. If you&rsquo;re hosting a gathering, make sure all your guests have a sober ride home.  To spread this urgent safety message, NHTSA is kicking-off its annual Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over campaign and is working to end drunk driving on U.S. roads altogether through innovative technology called <b>the</b> <b>Driver</b> <b>Alcohol</b> <b>Detection</b> System for <b>Safety</b> (DADSS).  <b>Drive</b> <b>Sober</b> <b>or</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Pulled</b> <b>Over</b> is a national high-visibility enforcement campaign that runs during specific times of the year. This campaign focuses on the consequences of drunk driving and is supported by increased law enforcement. Many assets are available in English and Spanish.  To help combat impaired driving, NHTSA reminds you: Drive Sober or <b>Get</b> Pulled <b>Over</b> and If You Feel Different, You Drive Different &ndash; Drive High Get a DUI. These campaigns, which run Dec. 13 through Jan. 1, aim to educate people about the dangers and consequences of impaired driving.  <b>Drive</b> <b>Sober</b> or <b>Get</b> <b>Pulled</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Drunk</b> <b>driving</b> endangers those behind the wheel, their passengers, and other people on the road. Law enforcement partners know how to spot an impaired driver and will not hesitate to pull them over. If you&rsquo;re going to drink, plan for a sober ride.  WASHINGTON &ndash; As millions of Americans get on the roads to travel home and spend the Thanksgiving holiday reconnecting with friends and loved ones, the U.S. Department of Transportation is serving them a reminder: &ldquo;Make It to the <b>Table</b>: <b>Don</b>&rsquo;<b>t</b> <b>Drink</b> and <b>Drive</b> this Thanksgiving Eve.&rdquo;  Scroll through the calendar and click any date for campaign material. Printable PDFs and events calendar are available at the bottom. <b>Thanksgiving</b> | Buckle Up. Every Trip. Every Time. PDF versions of the above Communication Calendar are available for download. Standard calendar that highlights campaigns each month.  As millions of Americans travel on U.S. roads to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with friends and family, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and its partners are urging the public to <b>drive</b> <b>sober</b> and to help spread the word.  This Thanksgiving, Naperville Police Department is joining the Illinois State Police and local law enforcement agencies to ensure holiday travelers are buckled up and driving sober. The &ldquo;Click It or Ticket&rdquo; and &ldquo;Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over&rdquo; enforcement campaign will run from <b>Nov</b>. 22 to Dec. 2. </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/930.html">What to cook early for thanksgiving</a>.
