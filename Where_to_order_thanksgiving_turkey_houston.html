        <h2><strong>Where to order thanksgiving turkey houston Thanksgiving classroom lessons</strong></h2>
        <p>Many Native Americans do not refer to this day as <b>Thanksgiving</b> but have their own unique names and traditions associated with the harvest season. To fully understand why Native Americans have a distinct perspective on Thanksgiving, it is essential to delve into the historical context.  How do <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> make peace with a national holiday that romanticizes the 1621 encounter between their ancestors and English settlers, and erases the deadly conflicts that followed?  The &quot;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; is often portrayed as a friendly harvest celebration where Pilgrims and generic, nameless Indians came together to eat and give thanks. This story is a myth that was sparked in the mid-1800s when English accounts of the 1621 harvest event resurfaced and fueled the <b>American</b> imagination.  While some <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> have chosen to reject the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday entirely, many embrace the positive messages of the day and choose to put aside thoughts about its complex history. This is because the idea of giving thanks is central to Native heritage and culture.  Although <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> people have always given thanks for the world around them, the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday celebrated today is more a combination of Puritan religious practices and the European festival called Harvest Home, which then grew to encompass <b>Native</b> foods.  In today&rsquo;s world, <b>Indigenous</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> is celebrated in diverse ways across North America. Some communities may hold traditional ceremonies, dances, and feasts, while others may incorporate contemporary expressions of gratitude and cultural celebration into their Thanksgiving events.  Explore the <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> tradition of <b>naming</b> a person and the cultural meaning behind sacred <b>names</b>.

Here is the whole story. Paula Peters remembers learning about the...  The true history of <b>Thanksgiving</b> begins with the Indians.
