        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving dinner delivery denver Ark thanksgiving event</strong></h2>
        <p><b>What Did</b> the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>Eat</b> on the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Many dishes served during modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> meals were not present at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have potatoes, nor <b>did</b> they have butter or flour necessary for making pies.  Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of the harvest celebration shared by the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony ...  The Thanksgiving meal is remarkably consistent in its <b>elements</b>: the <b>turkey</b>, the <b>stuffing</b>, the <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b>, the <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>. Barring ethical, health, or religious objections, it is pretty much the same meal for everyone, across latitudes and longitudes, and through the years of their lives.  When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>did</b> <b>eat</b> turkey in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  <b>Turkey</b>, <b>corn</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> are all Thanksgiving staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the first Thanksgiving? The answer might surprise you!  For most people, <b>enjoying</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>. But how did the Pilgrims...  What Did the Pilgrims Eat? Today, we <b>eat</b> <b>turkey</b>, <b>stuffing</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>vegetables</b> as the base feast for our Thanksgivings. We also tend to have lots of pies and bread.  A giant Pilgrim-themed turkey float is a fixture in New York&rsquo;s annual Macy&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Parade. Hiroko Masuike/Getty Images <b>Did</b> they or didn&rsquo;t they <b>eat</b> it? The only firsthand record of what the <b>Pilgrims</b> ate at the first <b>thanksgiving</b> feast comes from Edward Winslow. He noted that the Wampanoag leader, Massasoit, arrived with 90 men ...  So what foods were served at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to food historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well. </p>        <p><a href="https://thankgivings.github.io/576.html">Writing thanksgiving stories</a>.
