        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving cat cards Thanksgiving 2024 nfl game schedule</strong></h2>
        <p>This ancient prayer of Thanksgiving comes from the <b>Haudenosaunee</b> (Iroquois) people. The prayer is used to give thanks, bless gatherings, and greet the day. I plan to read it at a Thanksgiving gathering this year and hope it touches your heart as much as it touches mine.  Native Americans had entire ceremonies just for the purpose of expressing thanks &ndash; sometimes the ceremonies lasted for days. This <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Prayer</b> comes from the Seneca Nation and is at least 500 years old. It is traditionally done around a fire, with spiritual food on the altar.  <b>Haudenosaunee</b> (Iroquois) Thanksgiving Address. Ohen:ton Karihwatehkwen &ldquo;Words Before All Else&rdquo; This prayer is a gift from the Haudenosaunee People (The Iroquois Nation), words of thanksgiving with ancient roots dating back to when the Great Law of Peace was brought to the people by the Peace Maker, the Iroquois prophet, statesman, and lawgiver.  These are the opening words of the <b>Ohenten</b> <b>Kariwatekwen</b>, also known as the Thanksgiving Address, a traditional prayer or greeting recited in Akwesasne. Often meetings start and end with the greeting as a way to get everyone in a good mind to work together for the best for all.  Translated by: Chuck Larsen, Seneca. Gwa! Now the time has come! Hear us, Lord of the Sky! We are here to speak the truth, For you do not hear lies, We are your children, Lord of the Sky. Now begins the Gayant&rsquo; gogwus. This sacred fire and sacred tobacco. And through this smoke. We offer our <b>prayers</b>. We are your children, Lord of the Sky.  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> Address (the Ohen:ton Karihwatehkwen) is the central <b>prayer</b> and invocation for the Haudenosaunee (also known as the Iroquois Confederacy or Six Nations &mdash; Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora). It reflects their relationship of giving thanks for life and the world around them.  This <b>prayer</b> takes its inspiration from the verse in Psalm 24, &ldquo;The earth is God&rsquo;s.&rdquo; We begin by acknowledging that this land belongs to no one. We then honor the ancestral Native peoples who cared for this land, followed by our own immigrant ancestors who endured hardship to come here.  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> Address acknowledges the people, earth, waters, plants, animals, birds, bushes, trees, winds, sun, moon, stars, as well as the unseen spiritual forces. There are a multitude of connections between human beings and other living beings in the world.
