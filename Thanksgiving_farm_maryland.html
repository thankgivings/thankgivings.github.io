        <p>Treat your <b>side</b> <b>dishes</b> with the attention they deserve with this helpful guide on how to <b>keep</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>sides</b> <b>warm</b> all day! <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a long one!

There are lots of <b>dishes</b> and prep that can be done ahead of <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, in order to to free up some time and space in the kitchen. For example, Sepsy recommends making a base gravy ahead of time.  If you place the side dishes in aluminum pans and use stands, you can keep the food warm by lighting a <b>Sterno</b> or two underneath each dish. This method is most effective when you are serving Thanksgiving dinner in a buffet style, rather than serving it all on the table.  The low setting on slow cookers (and often the &ldquo;<b>keep</b> <b>warm</b>&rdquo; setting on countertop pressure cookers) can <b>keep</b> <b>sides</b> like mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and corn or gravy <b>warm</b> for an extended period of time. If you&rsquo;ve made the <b>dishes</b> ahead, you can also use a slow cooker to reheat them with great results.  There are several ways to keep Thanksgiving sides warm, including <b>using</b> <b>warming</b> <b>trays</b>, <b>slow</b> cookers, or <b>chafing</b> dishes. It&rsquo;s important to make sure that the sides are heated to a safe temperature, typically around 165&deg;F, before transferring them to a warming device.  Check out these tools and appliances that can <b>keep</b> your <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal <b>warm</b> when your stove and oven are occupied.  The &ldquo;<b>keep</b> <b>warm</b>&rdquo; setting on your <b>countertop</b> <b>pressure</b> cookers) can also keep your side dishes warm for an extended period of time. In the event that you prepared your dishes much earlier, these can also be used to reheat them. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving dinner staunton va. Thanksgiving day weekend canada.
